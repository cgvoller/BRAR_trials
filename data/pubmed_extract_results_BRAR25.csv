BAN2401-G000-201, a randomized double-blind clinical trial, utilized a Bayesian design with response-adaptive randomization to assess 3 doses across 2 regimens of lecanemab versus placebo in early Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild AD dementia. Methods: BAN2401-G000-201 aimed to establish the effective dose 90% (ED90), defined as the simplest dose that achieves ?90% of the maximum treatment effect. The primary endpoint was Bayesian analysis of 12-month clinical change on the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS) for the ED90 dose, which required an 80% probability of ?25% clinical reduction in decline versus placebo. Key secondary endpoints included 18-month Bayesian and frequentist analyses of brain amyloid reduction using positron emission tomography; clinical decline on ADCOMS, Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB), and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog14); changes in CSF core biomarkers; and total hippocampal volume (HV) using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging. Results: A total of 854 randomized subjects were treated (lecanemab, 609; placebo, 245). At 12 months, the 10-mg/kg biweekly ED90 dose showed a 64% probability to be better than placebo by 25% on ADCOMS, which missed the 80% threshold for the primary outcome. At 18 months, 10-mg/kg biweekly lecanemab reduced brain amyloid (-0.306 SUVr units) while showing a drug-placebo difference in favor of active treatment by 27% and 30% on ADCOMS, 56% and 47% on ADAS-Cog14, and 33% and 26% on CDR-SB versus placebo according to Bayesian and frequentist analyses, respectively. CSF biomarkers were supportive of a treatment effect. Lecanemab was well-tolerated with 9.9% incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema/effusion at 10 mg/kg biweekly. Conclusions: BAN2401-G000-201 did not meet the 12-month primary endpoint. However, prespecified 18-month Bayesian and frequentist analyses demonstrated reduction in brain amyloid accompanied by a consistent reduction of clinical decline across several clinical and biomarker endpoints.

In contemporary early-phase dose-finding trials, especially in oncology with targeted agents or immunotherapy, a more relevant aim is to identify the lowest dose level that maximises efficacy whilst remaining tolerable. Backfilling, defined as the practice of assigning patients to dose levels lower than the current highest tolerated dose, has been proposed to gather additional pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and biomarker data to recommend the most appropriate dose to carry forward for subsequent studies. The first formal framework [5] for backfilling proposed randomising backfill patients with equal probability among those doses below the dose level where the study is currently at. Here, we propose to use Bayesian response-adaptive randomisation to backfill patients. This patient-oriented approach to backfilling aims to allocate more patients to dose levels in the backfill set with higher expected efficacy based on emerging data. The backfill set constitutes of the doses below the dose the dose-finding algorithm is at. At study completion, collective patient data inform the dose-response curve, suggesting an optimal dose level balancing toxicity and efficacy. Our simulation study across diverse clinical trial settings demonstrates that a backfilling strategy using Bayesian response-adaptive randomisation can result in a patient-oriented patient assignment procedure which simultaneously enhances the likelihood of correctly identifying the most appropriate dose level. This contribution offers a methodological framework and practical implementation for patient-oriented backfilling, encompassing design and analysis considerations in early-phase trials.

In the Established Status Epilepticus Treatment Trial (ESETT) we compared the efficacy and safety of levetiracetam, fosphenytoin, and valproate in established status epilepticus, and here we describe our results after extending enrolment in children to compare outcomes in three age groups. Methods: In this multicentre, double-blind, response-adaptive, randomised controlled trial, we recruited patients from 58 hospital emergency departments across the USA. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 2 years or older, had been treated for a generalised convulsive seizure of longer than 5 min duration with adequate doses of benzodiazepines, and continued to have persistent or recurrent convulsions in the emergency department for at least 5 min and no more than 30 min after the last dose of benzodiazepine. Patients were randomly assigned in a response-adaptive manner, using Bayesian methods and stratified by age group (<18 years, 18-65 years, and >65 years), to levetiracetam, fosphenytoin, or valproate. All patients, investigators, study staff, and pharmacists were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was absence of clinically apparent seizures with improved consciousness and without additional antiseizure medication at 1 h from start of drug infusion. The primary safety outcome was life-threatening hypotension or cardiac arrhythmia. The efficacy and safety outcomes were analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01960075. Findings: Between Nov 3, 2015, and Dec 29, 2018, we enrolled 478 patients and 462 unique patients were included: 225 children (aged <18 years), 186 adults (18-65 years), and 51 older adults (>65 years). 175 (38%) patients were randomly assigned to levetiracetam, 142 (31%) to fosphenyltoin, and 145 (31%) were to valproate. Baseline characteristics were balanced across treatments within age groups. The primary efficacy outcome was met in those treated with levetiracetam for 52% (95% credible interval 41-62) of children, 44% (33-55) of adults, and 37% (19-59) of older adults; with fosphenytoin in 49% (38-61) of children, 46% (34-59) of adults, and 35% (17-59) of older adults; and with valproate in 52% (41-63) of children, 46% (34-58) of adults, and 47% (25-70) of older adults. No differences were detected in efficacy or primary safety outcome by drug within each age group. With the exception of endotracheal intubation in children, secondary safety outcomes did not significantly differ by drug within each age group. Interpretation: Children, adults, and older adults with established status epilepticus respond similarly to levetiracetam, fosphenytoin, and valproate, with treatment success in approximately half of patients. Any of the three drugs can be considered as a potential first-choice, second-line drug for benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus.

Tailoring the ventilation supply technique according to the responsiveness of patients to positive end-expiratory pressure is a suitable setting for such a design. Methods: In the setting of marker-strategy design, we propose a Bayesian response-adaptive randomisation with enrichment design based on group sequential analyses. This design combines the elements of enrichment design and response-adaptive randomisation. Concerning the enrichment strategy, Bayesian treatment-by-subset interaction measures were used to adaptively enrich the patients most likely to benefit from an experimental treatment while controlling the false-positive rate.The operating characteristics of the design were assessed by simulation and compared to those of alternate designs. Results: The results obtained allowed the detection of the superiority of one treatment over another and the presence of a treatment-by-subgroup interaction while keeping the false-positive rate at approximately 5\% and reducing the average number of included patients. In addition, simulation studies identified that the number of interim analyses and the burn-in period may have an impact on the performance of the scheme. Conclusion: The proposed design highlights important objectives of precision medicine, such as determining whether the experimental treatment is superior to another and identifying wheter such an efficacy could depend on patient profile.

To determine if the addition of docetaxel to gemcitabine improved clinical outcome of patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcomas, we compared a fixed dose rate infusion of gemcitabine versus a lower dose of gemcitabine with docetaxel. Patients and methods: In this open-label phase II clinical trial, the primary end point was tumor response, defined as complete or partial response or stable disease lasting at least 24 weeks. A Bayesian adaptive randomization procedure was used to produce an imbalance in the randomization in favor of the superior treatment, accounting for treatment-subgroup interactions. Results: One hundred nineteen of 122 randomly assigned patients had assessable outcomes. The adaptive randomization assigned 73 patients (60%) to gemcitabine-docetaxel and 49 patients (40%) to gemcitabine alone, indicating gemcitabine-docetaxel was superior. The objective Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors response rates were 16% (gemcitabine-docetaxel) and 8% (gemcitabine). Given the data, the posterior probabilities that gemcitabine-docetaxel was superior for progression-free and overall survival were 0.98 and 0.97, respectively. Median progression-free survival was 6.2 months for gemcitabine-docetaxel and 3.0 months for gemcitabine alone; median overall survival was 17.9 months for gemcitabine-docetaxel and 11.5 months for gemcitabine. The posterior probability that patients receiving gemcitabine-docetaxel had a shorter time to discontinuation for toxicity compared with gemcitabine alone was .999. Conclusion: Gemcitabine-docetaxel yielded superior progression-free and overall survival to gemcitabine alone, but with increased toxicity.

Our work is motivated by recent master protocols in oncology, where several treatments are investigated simultaneously in one or multiple disease types, and treatment efficacy is expected to vary across biomarker-defined subpopulations. Adaptive trials such as I-SPY-2 (Barker et al., 2009) and BATTLE (Zhou et al., 2008) are special cases within our framework. We discuss the application of our adaptive scheme to two distinct research goals. The first is to identify a biomarker subpopulation for which a therapy shows evidence of treatment efficacy, and to exclude other subpopulations for which such evidence does not exist. This leads to a subpopulation-finding design. The second is to identify, within biomarker-defined subpopulations, a set of cancer types for which an experimental therapy is superior to the standard-of-care. This goal leads to a subpopulation-stratified design. Using simulations constructed to faithfully represent ongoing cancer sequencing projects, we quantify the potential gains of our proposed designs relative to conventional non-adaptive designs.

Three initial experimental arms (abemaciclib [a cyclin-dependent kinase [CDK]4/6 inhibitor], neratinib [an epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 inhibitor], and CC-115 [a deoxyribonucleic acid-dependent protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor]) were simultaneously evaluated against a common control arm. We report the results for each arm and examine the feasibility and conduct of the adaptive platform design. Patients and methods: Patients with newly diagnosed O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase-unmethylated glioblastoma were eligible if they had tumor genotyping to identify prespecified biomarker subpopulations of dominant glioblastoma signaling pathways (EGFR, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and CDK). Initial random assignment was 1:1:1:1 between control (radiation therapy and temozolomide) and the experimental arms. Subsequent Bayesian adaptive randomization was incorporated on the basis of biomarker-specific progression-free survival (PFS) data. The primary end point was overall survival (OS), and one-sided P values are reported. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02977780). Results: Two hundred thirty-seven patients were treated (71 control; 73 abemaciclib; 81 neratinib; 12 CC-115) in years 2017-2021. Abemaciclib and neratinib were well tolerated, but CC-115 was associated with ? grade 3 treatment-related toxicity in 58% of patients. PFS was significantly longer with abemaciclib (hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.49 to 1.06; one-sided P = .046) and neratinib (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.02; one-sided P = .033) relative to the control arm but there was no PFS benefit with CC-115 (one-sided P = .523). None of the experimental therapies demonstrated a significant OS benefit (P > .05). Conclusion: The INSIGhT design enabled efficient simultaneous testing of three experimental agents using a shared control arm and adaptive randomization.

Here we performed a phase 2 clinical trial of metronomic chemotherapy combined with PD-1 blockade to compare the efficacy of combined conventional chemotherapy and PD-1 blockade using Bayesian adaptive randomization and efficacy monitoring. Eligible patients had metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer and had not received more than one prior line of standard chemotherapy. Patients (total n = 97) were randomized to receive (1) metronomic vinorelbine (NVB) monotherapy (n = 11), (2) NVB plus anti-PD-1 toripalimab (n = 7), (3) anti-angiogenic bevacizumab, NVB and toripalimab (n = 27), (4) conventional cisplatin, NVB and toripalimab (n = 26), or (5) metronomic cyclophosphamide, capecitabine, NVB and toripalimab (the VEX cohort) (n = 26). The primary endpoint was disease control rate (DCR). Secondary objectives included progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. The study met the primary endpoint. The VEX (69.7%) and cisplatin (73.7%) cohorts had the highest DCR. The median PFS of patients in the VEX cohort was the longest, reaching 6.6 months, followed by the bevacizumab (4.0 months) and cisplatin (3.5 months) cohorts. In general, the five regimens were well tolerated, with nausea and neutropenia being the most common adverse events. An exploratory mass cytometry analysis indicated that metronomic VEX chemotherapy reprograms the systemic immune response. Together, the clinical and translational data of this study indicate that metronomic VEX chemotherapy combined with PD-1 blockade can be a treatment option in patients with breast cancer.

These designs are desirable for patients/stakeholders, particularly in comparative effectiveness research, due to the potential benefits including improving participant buy-in by providing more participants with better treatment during the trial. Frequentist approaches have often been used, but adaptive designs naturally fit the Bayesian methodology; it was developed to deal with data as they come in by updating prior information. Methods: PAIN-CONTRoLS was a comparative-effectiveness trial utilizing Bayesian response adaptive randomization to four drugs, nortriptyline, duloxetine, pregabalin, or mexiline, for cryptogenic sensory polyneuropathy (CSPN) patients. The aim was to determine which treatment was most tolerable and effective in reducing pain. Quit and efficacy rates were combined into a utility function to develop a single outcome, which with treatment sample size, drove the adaptive randomization. Prespecified interim analyses allowed the study to stop for early success or update the randomization probabilities to the better-performing treatments. Results: Seven adaptations to the randomization occurred before the trial ended due to reaching the maximum sample size, with more participants receiving nortriptyline and duloxetine. At the end of the follow-up, nortriptyline and duloxetine had lower probabilities of participants that had stopped taking the study medication and higher probabilities were efficacious. Mexiletine had the highest quit rate, but had an efficacy rate higher than pregabalin. Conclusions: Response adaptive randomization has become a popular trial tool, especially for those utilizing Bayesian methods for analyses.

In the setting of failure time outcomes, Zhang and Rosenberger (2007) developed a response-adaptive randomisation approach that targets an optimal allocation, based on a fixed sample size. Objectives: The aim of this research is to propose a response-adaptive randomisation procedure for survival trials with an interim monitoring plan, based on the following optimal criterion: for fixed variance of the estimated log hazard ratio, what allocation minimizes the expected hazard of failure? We demonstrate the utility of the design by redesigning a clinical trial on multiple myeloma. Methods: To handle continuous monitoring of data, we propose a Bayesian response-adaptive randomisation procedure, where the log hazard ratio is the effect measure of interest. Combining the prior with the normal likelihood, the mean posterior estimate of the log hazard ratio allows derivation of the optimal target allocation. We perform a simulation study to assess and compare the performance of this proposed Bayesian hybrid adaptive design to those of fixed, sequential or adaptive - either frequentist or fully Bayesian - designs. Non informative normal priors of the log hazard ratio were used, as well as mixture of enthusiastic and skeptical priors. Stopping rules based on the posterior distribution of the log hazard ratio were computed. The method is then illustrated by redesigning a phase III randomised clinical trial of chemotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma, with mixture of normal priors elicited from experts. Results: As expected, there was a reduction in the proportion of observed deaths in the adaptive vs. non-adaptive designs; this reduction was maximized using a Bayes mixture prior, with no clear-cut improvement by using a fully Bayesian procedure. The use of stopping rules allows a slight decrease in the observed proportion of deaths under the alternate hypothesis compared with the adaptive designs with no stopping rules. Conclusions: Such Bayesian hybrid adaptive survival trials may be promising alternatives to traditional designs, reducing the duration of survival trials, as well as optimizing the ethical concerns for patients enrolled in the trial.

However, trials of these combinations are lower priority than those that develop novel therapies, which can restrict funding, timelines and patient availability. This article develops a novel trial design to facilitate the evaluation of New combination therapies. This trial design combines elements of phase II and phase III trials to reduce the burden of evaluating combination therapies, while also maintaining a feasible sample size. This design was developed for a randomised trial that compares the properties of three combination doses of ketamine and dexmedetomidine, given intranasally, to ketamine delivered intravenously for children undergoing a closed reduction for a fracture or dislocation. Methods: This trial design uses response-adaptive randomisation to evaluate different dose combinations and increase the information collected for successful novel drug combinations. The design then uses Bayesian dose-response modelling to undertake a comparative effectiveness analysis for the most successful dose combination against a relevant comparator. We used simulation methods determine the thresholds for adapting the trial and making conclusions. We also used simulations to evaluate the probability of selecting the dose combination with the highest true effectiveness the operating characteristics of the design and its Bayesian predictive power. Results: With 410 participants, five interim updates of the randomisation ratio and a probability of effectiveness of 0.93, 0.88 and 0.83 for the three dose combinations, we have an 83% chance of randomising the largest number of patients to the drug with the highest probability of effectiveness. Based on this adaptive randomisation procedure, the comparative effectiveness analysis has a type I error of less than 5% and a 93% chance of correcting concluding non-inferiority, when the probability of effectiveness for the optimal combination therapy is 0.9. In this case, the trial has a greater than 77% chance of meeting its dual aims of dose-finding and comparative effectiveness. Finally, the Bayesian predictive power of the trial is over 90%. Conclusions: By simultaneously determining the optimal dose and collecting data on the relative effectiveness of an intervention, we can minimise administrative burden and recruitment time for a trial. This will minimise the time required to get effective, safe combination therapies to patients quickly. The proposed trial has high potential to meet the dual study objectives within a feasible overall sample size.

Methods: We built a response-adaptive randomization procedure, adapting on two preliminary outcomes for tuberculosis patients in a trial with five experimental regimens and a control arm. The primary study outcome is treatment success after 73 weeks from randomization; preliminary responses are culture conversion at 8 weeks and treatment success at 39 weeks. We compared the adaptive randomization design with balanced randomization using hypothetical scenarios. Results: When we compare the statistical power under adaptive randomization and non-adaptive designs, under several hypothetical scenarios we observe that adaptive randomization requires fewer patients than non-adaptive designs. Moreover, adaptive randomization consistently allocates more participants to effective arm(s). We also show that these advantages are limited to scenarios consistent with the assumptions used to develop the adaptive randomization algorithm. Conclusion: Given the objective of evaluating several new therapeutic regimens in a timely fashion, Bayesian response-adaptive designs are attractive for tuberculosis trials.

The intervention arm for the current trial often requires prospective data to assess a novel treatment, and thus borrowing historical control data commensurate in distribution to current control data is motivated in order to increase the allocation ratio to the current intervention arm. Existing historical control borrowing adaptive designs adjust allocation ratios based on the commensurability assessed through study-level summary statistics of the response agnostic of the distributions of the trial subject characteristics in the current and historical trials. This can lead to distributional imbalance of the current trial subject characteristics across the treatment arms as well as between current control data and borrowed historical control data. Such covariate imbalance may threaten the internal validity of the current trial by introducing confounding factors that affect study endpoints. In this article, we propose a Bayesian design which borrows and updates the treatment allocation ratios both covariate-adaptively and commensurate to covariate dependently assessed similarity between the current and historical control data. We employ covariate-dependent discrepancy parameters which are allowed to grow with the sample size and propose a regularized local regression procedure for the estimation of the parameters. The proposed design also permits the current and the historical controls to be similar to varying degree, depending on the subject level characteristics. We evaluate the proposed design extensively under the settings derived from two placebo-controlled randomized trials on vertebral fracture risk in post-menopausal women.

In many trials evaluating longitudinal patient outcomes, RAR methods based only on the final measurement may not benefit significantly from RAR because of its delayed initiation. We propose a Bayesian RAR method to improve RAR performance by accounting for longitudinal patient outcomes (longitudinal RAR). We use a Bayesian linear mixed effects model to analyze longitudinal continuous patient outcomes for calculating a patient allocation probability. In addition, we aim to mitigate the loss of statistical power because of large patient allocation imbalances by embedding adjusters into the patient allocation probability calculation. Using extensive simulation we compared the operating characteristics of our proposed longitudinal RAR method with those of the RAR method based only on the final measurement and with an equal randomization method. Simulation results showed that our proposed longitudinal RAR method assigned more patients to the presumably superior treatment arm compared with the other two methods. In addition, the embedded adjuster effectively worked to prevent extreme patient allocation imbalances. However, our proposed method may not function adequately when the treatment effect difference is moderate or less, and still needs to be modified to deal with unexpectedly large departures from the presumed longitudinal data model.

The implementation of these designs using the Thompson sampling methods has generally assumed a simple beta-binomial probability model in the literature; however, the effect of these choices on the resulting design operating characteristics relative to other reasonable alternatives has not been fully examined. Motivated by the Advanced R2 Eperfusion STrategies for Refractory Cardiac Arrest trial, we posit that a logistic probability model coupled with an urn or permuted block randomization method will alleviate some of the practical limitations engendered by the conventional implementation of a two-arm Bayesian response-adaptive design with binary outcomes. In this article, we discuss up to what extent this solution works and when it does not. Methods: A computer simulation study was performed to evaluate the relative merits of a Bayesian response-adaptive design for the Advanced R2 Eperfusion STrategies for Refractory Cardiac Arrest trial using the Thompson sampling methods based on a logistic regression probability model coupled with either an urn or permuted block randomization method that limits deviations from the evolving target allocation ratio. The different implementations of the response-adaptive design were evaluated for type I error rate control across various null response rates and power, among other performance metrics. Results: The logistic regression probability model engenders smaller average sample sizes with similar power, better control over type I error rate, and more favorable treatment arm sample size distributions than the conventional beta-binomial probability model, and designs using the alternative randomization methods have a negligible chance of a sample size imbalance in the wrong direction. Conclusion: Pairing the logistic regression probability model with either of the alternative randomization methods results in a much improved response-adaptive design in regard to important operating characteristics, including type I error rate control and the risk of a sample size imbalance in favor of the inferior treatment.

The intent is noble: minimize the number of participants randomized to inferior treatments and increase the amount of information about better treatments. Unfortunately, RAR causes many problems, including (1) bias from temporal trends, (2) inefficiency in treatment effect estimation, (3) volatility in sample-size distributions that can cause a nontrivial proportion of trials to assign more patients to an inferior arm, (4) difficulty of validly analyzing results, and (5) the potential for selection bias and other issues inherent to being unblinded to ongoing results. The problems of RAR are most acute in the very setting for which RAR has been proposed, namely long-duration ""platform"" trials and infectious disease settings where temporal trends are ubiquitous.

A too optimistic use of the data, however, may result in bias under prior-data conflict. Motivated by well-publicized two-arm comparative trials in stroke, we propose a Bayesian design that both adaptively incorporates historical control data and selectively adapt the treatment allocation ratios within an ongoing trial responsively to the relative treatment effects. The proposed design differs from existing designs that borrow from historical controls. As opposed to reducing the number of subjects assigned to the control arm blindly, this design does so adaptively to the relative treatment effects only if evaluation of cumulated current trial data combined with the historical control suggests the superiority of the intervention arm. We used the effective historical sample size approach to quantify borrowed information on the control arm and modified the treatment allocation rules of the doubly adaptive biased coin design to incorporate the quantity. The modified allocation rules were then implemented under the Bayesian framework with commensurate priors addressing prior-data conflict. Trials were also more frequently concluded earlier in line with the underlying truth, reducing trial cost, and duration and yielded parameter estimates with smaller standard errors.

The family of randomisation procedures referred to as Constrained Randomised Dynamic Programming (CRDP), which is set in the Bayesian decision-theoretic framework, can be used to balance these competing objectives. A generalisation and novel interpretation of CRDP is proposed to highlight its inherent flexibility to adapt to a variety of practicalities and align with individual trial objectives. CRDP, as with most response-adaptive randomisation procedures, hinges on the limiting assumption of patient responses being available before allocation of the next patient. This forms one of the greatest barriers to their implementation in practice which, despite being an important research question, has not received a thorough treatment. Therefore, motivated by the existing gap between the theory of response-adaptive randomisation (which is abundant with proposed methods in the immediate response setting) and clinical practice (in which responses are typically delayed), the performance of CRDP in the presence of fixed and random delays is evaluated. Simulation results show that CRDP continues to offer patient benefit gains over alternative procedures and is relatively robust to delayed responses. To compensate for a fixed delay, a method which adjusts the time horizon used in the optimisation objective is proposed and its performance illustrated.

Moreover, given limited resources, it is difficult to robustly identify a dose while also testing for a signal of efficacy that would support a phase III trial. Recent designs have sought to be more efficient by exploring multiple doses through the use of adaptive strategies. However, the added flexibility may potentially increase the risk of making incorrect assumptions and reduce the total amount of information available across the dose range as a function of imbalanced sample size. Methods: To balance these challenges, a novel placebo-controlled design is presented in which a restricted Bayesian response adaptive randomization (RAR) is used to allocate a majority of subjects to the optimal dose of active drug, defined as the dose with the lowest probability of poor outcome. However, the allocation between subjects who receive active drug or placebo is held constant to retain the maximum possible power for a hypothesis test of overall efficacy comparing the optimal dose to placebo. The design properties and optimization of the design are presented in the context of a phase II trial for subarachnoid hemorrhage. Results: For a fixed total sample size, a trade-off exists between the ability to select the optimal dose and the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis. This relationship is modified by the allocation ratio between active and control subjects, the choice of RAR algorithm, and the number of subjects allocated to an initial fixed allocation period. While a responsive RAR algorithm improves the ability to select the correct dose, there is an increased risk of assigning more subjects to a worse arm as a function of ephemeral trends in the data. A subarachnoid treatment trial is used to illustrate how this design can be customized for specific objectives and available data. Conclusions: Bayesian adaptive designs are a flexible approach to addressing multiple questions surrounding the optimal dose for treatment efficacy within the context of limited resources. While the design is general enough to apply to many situations, future work is needed to address interim analyses and the incorporation of models for dose response.

In this study, we developed a Bayesian response-adaptive randomization (RAR) design targeting the endpoint of organ support-free days (OSFD) for patients admitted to the intensive care units. The OSFD is a mixture of mortality and morbidity assessed by the number of days of free of organ support within a predetermined post-randomization time-window. In the past, researchers treated OSFD as an ordinal outcome variable where the lowest category is death. We propose a novel RAR design for a composite endpoint of mortality and morbidity, for example, OSFD, by using a Bayesian mixture model with a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the posterior probability distribution of OSFD and determine treatment allocation ratios at each interim. Simulations were conducted to compare the performance of our proposed design under various randomization rules and different alpha spending functions. The results show that our RAR design using Bayesian inference allocated more patients to the better performing arm(s) compared to other existing adaptive rules while assuring adequate power and type I error rate control across a range of plausible clinical scenarios.

Adaptive designs have increased likelihood of complexity and also potential bias, so it is important to understand the common types of adaptive designs.

The aim of this work was to demonstrate how Bayesian adaptive designs can be constructed for multi-arm phase III clinical trials and assess potential benefits that these designs offer. Methods: We constructed several alternative Bayesian adaptive designs for the Collaborative Ankle Support Trial (CAST), which was a randomised controlled trial that compared four treatments for severe ankle sprain. These designs incorporated response adaptive randomisation (RAR), arm dropping, and early stopping for efficacy or futility. We studied the operating characteristics of the Bayesian designs via simulation. We then virtually re-executed the trial by implementing the Bayesian adaptive designs using patient data sampled from the CAST study to demonstrate the practical applicability of the designs. Results: We constructed five Bayesian adaptive designs, each of which had high power and recruited fewer patients on average than the original designs target sample size. The virtual executions showed that most of the Bayesian designs would have led to trials that declared superiority of one of the interventions over the control. Bayesian adaptive designs with RAR or arm dropping were more likely to allocate patients to better performing arms at each interim analysis. Similar estimates and conclusions were obtained from the Bayesian adaptive designs as from the original trial. Conclusions: Using CAST as an example, this case study shows how Bayesian adaptive designs can be constructed for phase III multi-arm trials using clinically relevant decision criteria. These designs demonstrated that they can potentially generate earlier results and allocate more patients to better performing arms.

This challenge is amplified in comparative effectiveness research where multiple treatments are compared to identify the best treatment. Novel efficient clinical trial designs are in urgent need in these areas. Our proposed response adaptive randomization (RAR) reusing participants trial design mimics the real-world clinical practice that allows patients to switch treatments when desired outcome is not achieved. The proposed design increases efficiency by two strategies: 1) Allowing participants to switch treatments so that each participant can have more than one observation and hence it is possible to control for participant specific variability to increase statistical power; and 2) Utilizing RAR to allocate more participants to the promising arms such that ethical and efficient studies will be achieved. Extensive simulations were conducted and showed that, compared with trials where each participant receives one treatment, the proposed participants reusing RAR design can achieve comparable power with a smaller sample size and a shorter trial duration, especially when the accrual rate is low. The efficiency gain decreases as the accrual rate increases. Keywords: Bayesian Adaptive Model; Comparative Effectiveness Research; hierarchical models; response adaptive randomization.",,Y,,,

In practice, it is often assumed based on preclinical data that a treatment-sensitive subpopulation is known, and moreover that the agent is substantively efficacious in that subpopulation. Due to important differences between preclinical settings and human biology, however, data from patients treated with a new targeted agent often show that one or both of these assumptions are false. This paper provides a Bayesian randomized group sequential enrichment design that compares an experimental treatment to a control based on survival time and uses early response as an ancillary outcome to assist with adaptive variable selection and enrichment. Initially, the design enrolls patients under broad eligibility criteria. At each interim decision, submodels for regression of response and survival time on a baseline covariate vector and treatment are fit; variable selection is used to identify a covariate subvector that characterizes treatment-sensitive patients and determines a personalized benefit index, and comparative superiority and futility decisions are made. Enrollment of each cohort is restricted to the most recent adaptively identified treatment-sensitive patients. Group sequential decision cutoffs are calibrated to control overall type I error and account for the adaptive enrollment restriction. The design provides a basis for precision medicine by identifying a treatment-sensitive subpopulation, if it exists, and determining whether the experimental treatment is superior to the control in that subpopulation. A simulation study shows that the proposed design reliably identifies a sensitive subpopulation, yields much higher generalized power compared to several existing enrichment designs and a conventional all-comers group sequential design, and is robust.

To evaluate the performance of the new design, in addition to the commonly considered criteria of type I error and power, we propose four new criteria measuring the benefits and losses for individuals both inside and outside of the clinical trial. Compared with designs with equal randomization, the proposed design gives trial participants a better chance to receive their personalized optimal treatments and thus results in a higher response rate on the trial. This design increases the chance to discover a successful new drug by an adaptive enrichment strategy, i.e., identification and selective enrollment of a subset of patients who are sensitive to the experimental therapies.

Strong biological rationale or early clinical evidence commonly suggest that the effect of the combination treatment is importantly greater than the maximum effect of any of the individual treatments. While these relationships are commonly well-accepted, RCTs do not incorporate them into the design or analysis plans. We therefore propose a simple Bayesian framework for incorporating the known relationships that the effectiveness of a combination treatment exceeds that of any individual treatment, but does not necessarily exceed the sum of individual effects. We term the collation of these two relationships 'fractional additivity'. We performed a binary outcome simulation study of a response adaptive randomized three-arm clinical trial with treatment arms A, B, and A&B that allowed for dropping an inferior treatment arm and terminating the trial early for superiority during any of 4 interim analyses. We compared the Bayesian fractional additivity model to a conventional analysis by measuring the expected proportion of failures, sample size at trial termination, time to termination, and root mean squared error of final estimates. We also compared the fractional additivity model to a 'full additivity' model where the effect of A&B was assumed to be the sum of the effect of A and B. In simulation scenarios where important fractional additivity or full additivity existed, the Bayesian fractional additivity model yielded a 3-4% relative reduction in expected number of failures, and a 30%-50% relative reduction in sample size at trial termination compared to a conventional analysis. These results held true even when the Bayesian fractional additivity model employed a biased prior. The full additivity model had slightly higher gains, but too frequently terminated the trial at the first interim look. In scenarios where no or weak fractional additivity exists, the expected sample size and time to termination were similar for the Bayesian fractional additivity model with a moderately optimistic bias about fractional additivity and the conventional model. Lastly, the fractional additivity model generally yielded similar or lower root mean squared error compared to the other models. In conclusion, our proposed Bayesian fractional additivity model provides an efficient approach for estimating effects of combination treatments in clinical trials. The approach is not only highly applicable in adaptive clinical trials, but also provides added power in a conventional RCT.

However, there is still a general reluctance to implement such designs in many clinical settings. One area of concern is that their frequentist operating characteristics are poor or, at least, poorly understood. We investigate the bias induced in the maximum likelihood estimate of a response probability parameter, p, for binary outcome by the process of adaptive randomization. We discover that it is small in magnitude and, under mild assumptions, can only be negative - causing one's estimate to be closer to zero on average than the truth. A simple unbiased estimator for p is obtained, but it is shown to have a large mean squared error. Two approaches are therefore explored to improve its precision based on inverse probability weighting and Rao-Blackwellization.

In this paper, we addressed challenges through the emerging methodology to investigate the dose-response relationship of High Definition-transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (HD tDCS), identifying the role of negative valence in tinnitus perception. In light of the neurofunctional testable framework and tES application, hypotheses were formulated to measure clinical and surrogate endpoints. We posited that conscious pairing adequately pleasant stimuli with tinnitus perception results in correction of the loudness misperception and would be reinforced by concurrent active HD-tDCS on the left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (dlPFC). The dose-response relationship between HD-tDCS specificity and the loudness perception is also modeled. We conducted a double-blind, randomized crossover pilot study with six recruited tinnitus patients. Accrued data was utilized to design a well-controlled adaptive seamless Bayesian dose-response study. The sample size (n = 47, for 90% power and 95% confidence) and optimum interims were anticipated for adaptive decision-making about efficacy, safety, and single session dose parameters. Furthermore, preliminary pilot study results were sufficient to show a significant difference (90% power, 99% confidence) within the longitudinally detected self-report tinnitus loudness between before and under positive emotion induction. This study demonstrated a research methodology used to improve emotion regulation in tinnitus patients. In the projected method, positive emotion induction is essential for promoting functional targeting under HD-tDCS anatomical specificity to indicate the efficacy and facilitate the dose-finding process. The continuous updating of prior knowledge about efficacy and dose during the exploratory stage adapts the anticipated dose-response model. Consequently, the effective dose range to make superiority neuromodulation in correcting loudness misperception of tinnitus will be redefined. Highly effective dose adapts the study to a standard randomized trial and transforms it into the confirmatory stage in which active HD-tDCS protocol is compared with a sham trial (placebo-like). Establishing the HD-tDCS intervention protocols relying on this novel method provides reliable evidence for regulatory agencies to approve or reject the efficacy and safety. Furthermore, this paper supports a technical report for designing multimodality data-driven complementary investigations in emotion regulation, including EEG-driven neuro markers, Stroop-driven attention biases, and neuroimaging-driven brain network dynamics.

Because of their complexity, it is important to develop highly optimized, transparent, and rigorous designs that are cost-efficient, offer high statistical power, maximize patient benefit, and are robust to changes over time. Methods: To address these needs, we present a Bayesian platform trial design based on a beta-binomial model for binary outcomes that uses three key strategies: (1) hierarchical modeling of subgroups within treatment arms that allows for borrowing of information across subgroups, (2) utilization of response-adaptive randomization (RAR) schemes that seek a tradeoff between statistical power and patient benefit, and (3) adjustment for potential drift over time. Motivated by a proposed clinical trial that aims to find the appropriate treatment for different subgroup populations of ischemic stroke patients, extensive simulation studies were performed to validate the approach, compare different allocation rules, and study the model operating characteristics. Results and conclusions: Our proposed approach achieved high statistical power and good patient benefit and was also robust against population drift over time.

The proposed KESETT study is a three-armed, randomized trial comparing two doses of ketamine plus levetiracetam to levetiracetam alone for treating patients with benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus. A Bayesian, adaptive clinical trial is proposed employing an ordinal primary outcome at 60 minutes ranging from 1 (improving consciousness and seizure cessation) to 5 (life-threatening event/death). Based on a previous study, the ordinal outcome is expected to have a bimodal distribution, with the effect of treatment expected to be non-proportional across the outcome scale. As such, approaches relying on assuming proportionality of the odds are not appropriate. We propose for this scenario an analytic approach to compare ordinal outcomes using the expected score derived from the posterior distribution for each treatment group. This approach requires minimal assumptions, maintains the benefit of using the full ordinal scale, is interpretable, and can be used in a Bayesian analysis framework. We compare this new approach under multiple simulated scenarios to 3 traditional frequentist approaches. The new approach controls type I error and power, resulting in a sizable reduction in sample size relative to a non-parametric test.

A major concern over the use of response-adaptive designs in practice, particularly from a regulatory viewpoint, is controlling the type I error rate. In particular, we show that the naïve z-test can have an inflated type I error rate even after applying a Bonferroni correction. Simulation studies have often been used to demonstrate error control but do not provide a guarantee. In this article, we present adaptive testing procedures for normally distributed outcomes that ensure strong familywise error control by iteratively applying the conditional invariance principle. Our approach can be used for fully sequential and block randomized trials and for a large class of adaptive randomization rules found in the literature. We show there is a high price to pay in terms of power to guarantee familywise error control for randomization schemes with extreme allocation probabilities. However, for proposed Bayesian adaptive randomization schemes in the literature, our adaptive tests maintain or increase the power of the trial compared to the z-test. We illustrate our method using a three-armed trial in primary hypercholesterolemia.

Methods: In a simulation study, we assume a trial with two treatments, two biomarker-based strata, and a binary clinical outcome (response). Pbt denotes the probability of response for treatment t (t = 0 or 1) in biomarker stratum (b = 0 or 1). Four different scenarios in terms of true underlying response probabilities are considered: a null (P00 = P01 = 0.25, P10 = P11= 0.25) and consistent (P00 = P10 = 0.25, P01 = 0.5) treatment effect scenario, as well as a quantitative (P00 = P01 = P10 = 0.25, P11 = 0.5) and a qualitative (P00 = P11 = 0.5, P01 = P10 = 0.25) stratum-treatment interaction. For each scenario, we compare the case of a perfect with the case of an imperfect biomarker assay with sensitivity and specificity of 0.8 and 0.7, respectively. In addition, biomarker-positive prevalence values P(B = 1) = 0.2 and 0.5 are investigated. Results: Results show that the use of an imperfect assay affects the operational characteristics of the Bayesian biomarker-based outcome-adaptive randomization design. In particular, the misclassification causes a substantial reduction in power accompanied by a considerable increase in the type-I error probability. The magnitude of these effects depends on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay, as well as on the distribution of the biomarker in the patient population. Conclusion: With an imperfect biomarker assay, the decision to apply a biomarker-based outcome-adaptive randomization design may require careful reflection.

A correct dose is one that is actually better than control. A popular model in phase II is an independent model that puts no structure on the dose-response relationship. Unfortunately, the independent model does not efficiently use information from related doses. One very successful alternate model improves power using a pre-specified dose-response structure. Past research indicates that EMAX models are broadly successful and therefore attractive for designing dose-response trials. However, there may be instances of slight risk of nonmonotone trends that need to be addressed when planning a clinical trial design. We propose to add hierarchical parameters to the EMAX model. The added layer allows information about the treatment effect in one dose to be ""borrowed"" when estimating the treatment effect in another dose. This is referred to as the hierarchical EMAX model. Our paper compares three different models (independent, EMAX, and hierarchical EMAX) and two different design strategies. The first design considered is Bayesian with a fixed trial design, and it has a fixed schedule for randomization. The second design is Bayesian but adaptive, and it uses response adaptive randomization.

These analyses may aid decisions regarding sample size, futility, and safety. Furthermore, they may provide evidence about potential differences between treatment arms. Bayesian response adaptive randomization (RAR) skews allocation proportions such that fewer participants are assigned to the inferior treatments. However, these allocation changes may introduce covariate imbalances. We discuss two versions of Bayesian RAR (with and without covariate adjustment for a binary covariate) for continuous outcomes analyzed using change scores and repeated measures, while considering either regression or mixed models for interim analysis modeling. Through simulation studies, we show that RAR (both versions) allocates more participants to better treatments compared to equal randomization, while reducing potential covariate imbalances. We also show that dynamic allocation using mixed models for repeated measures yields a smaller allocation proportion variance while having a similar covariate imbalance as regression models. Additionally, covariate imbalance was smallest for methods using covariate-adjusted RAR (CARA) in scenarios with small sample sizes and covariate prevalence less than 0.3. Covariate imbalance did not differ between RAR and CARA in simulations with larger sample sizes and higher covariate prevalence. We thus recommend a CARA approach for small pilot/exploratory studies for the identification of candidate treatments for further confirmatory studies.",,Y,,,

For various applications in quantum science, efficiently and accurately achieving a quantum transition frequency is essential. However, the exact relation between a desired transition frequency and the controllable experimental parameters is usually absent. Here, we propose an efficient scheme to search the suitable conditions for a desired magneto-sensitive transition via an adaptive Bayesian algorithm and experimentally demonstrate it by using coherent population trapping in an ensemble of laser-cooled 87Rb atoms. The transition frequency is controlled by an external magnetic field, which can be tuned in realtime by applying a d.c. voltage. Through an adaptive Bayesian algorithm, the voltage can automatically converge to the desired one from a random initial value only after few iterations (N ? 10). The response time is limited by the time of obtaining the spectrum signal, which is about 50 s for 10 iterations in our experiment. In particular, when the relation between the target frequency and the applied voltage is nonlinear (e.g., quadratic), our algorithm shows significant advantages over traditional methods. This work provides a simple and efficient way to determine a transition frequency, which can be widely applied in the fields of precision spectroscopy, such as atomic clocks, magnetometers, and nuclear magnetic resonance.",,Y,,,

The designs combine the Bayesian decision-theoretic sequential approach with adaptive randomization procedures in order to achieve simultaneous goals of improved efficiency and ethics. The design parameters represent the costs of different decisions, for example, the decisions for stopping or continuing the trials. The parameters enable us to incorporate the actual costs of the decisions in practice. The proposed designs allow the clinical trials to stop early for either efficacy or futility. Furthermore, the designs assign more patients to better treatment arms by applying adaptive randomization procedures. We develop an algorithm based on the constrained backward induction and forward simulation to implement the designs. The algorithm overcomes the computational difficulty of the backward induction method, thereby making our approach practicable. The designs result in trials with desirable operating characteristics under the simulated settings. Moreover, the designs are robust with respect to the response rate of the control group.",,Y,,,

Publications prior to 1990 included only three clinical trials that used Bayesian methods, but that number quickly jumped to 19 in the 1990s and to 99 from 2000 to 2012. While this literature provides many examples of Bayesian Adaptive Designs (BAD), none of the papers that are available walks the reader through the detailed process of conducting a BAD. This paper fills that gap by describing the BAD process used for one comparative effectiveness trial (Patient Assisted Intervention for Neuropathy: Comparison of Treatment in Real Life Situations) that can be generalized for use by others. A BAD was chosen with efficiency in mind. Response-adaptive randomization allows the potential for substantially smaller sample sizes, and can provide faster conclusions about which treatment or treatments are most effective. An Internet-based electronic data capture tool, which features a randomization module, facilitated data capture across study sites and an in-house computation software program was developed to implement the response-adaptive randomization. Results: A process for adapting randomization with minimal interruption to study sites was developed. A new randomization table can be generated quickly and can be seamlessly integrated in the data capture tool with minimal interruption to study sites. Conclusion: This manuscript is the first to detail the technical process used to evaluate a multisite comparative effectiveness trial using adaptive randomization. An important opportunity for the application of Bayesian trials is in comparative effectiveness trials.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces the blood transfusion requirements in adults and children during surgery. Several studies have evaluated TXA in adults with hemorrhagic trauma, but no randomized controlled trials have occurred in children with trauma. We propose a Bayesian adaptive clinical trial to investigate TXA in children with brain and/or torso hemorrhagic trauma. Methods/design: We designed a double-blind, Bayesian adaptive clinical trial that will enroll up to 2000 patients. We extend the traditional Emax dose-response model to incorporate a hierarchical structure so multiple doses of TXA can be evaluated in different injury populations (isolated head injury, isolated torso injury, or both head and torso injury). Up to 3 doses of TXA (15 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, and 45 mg/kg bolus doses) will be compared to placebo. Equal allocation between placebo, 15 mg/kg, and 30 mg/kg will be used for an initial period within each injury group. Depending on the dose-response curve, the 45 mg/kg arm may open in an injury group if there is a trend towards increasing efficacy based on the observed relationship using the data from the lower doses. Response-adaptive randomization allows each injury group to differ in allocation proportions of TXA so an optimal dose can be identified for each injury group. Frequent interim stopping periods are included to evaluate efficacy and futility. The statistical design is evaluated through extensive simulations to determine the operating characteristics in several plausible scenarios. This trial achieves adequate power in each injury group. Discussion: This trial design evaluating TXA in pediatric hemorrhagic trauma allows for three separate injury populations to be analyzed and compared within a single study framework. Individual conclusions regarding optimal dosing of TXA can be made within each injury group. Identifying the optimal dose of TXA, if any, for various injury types in childhood may reduce death and disability.

In this paper we propose and evaluate three Bayesian multivariate meta-analysis models: two multivariate analogues of the traditional univariate random effects models which make different assumptions about the relationships between studies and estimates, and a multivariate random effects model which is a Bayesian adaptation of the mixed model approach. Our preferred method is then illustrated through an analysis of a new data set on parental smoking and two health outcomes (asthma and lower respiratory disease) in children.",,Y,,,

It is desirable to propose a design that targets the same allocation proportion as Bayesian RAR and achieves the above objectives but addresses the concerns over Bayesian RAR. We propose the frequentist doubly adaptive biased coin designs (DBCD) targeting ethical allocation proportions from the Bayesian framework to satisfy different objectives in clinical trials with time-to-event endpoints. We derive the theoretical properties of the proposed adaptive randomization design and show through comprehensive numerical simulations that it can achieve ethical objectives without sacrificing efficiency.

However, modeling such data is challenged by the properties of these time-resolved profiles such as non-linearity, scarcity of measurement points, scheduling of the vaccine at multiple time points. Linear Mixed Models (LMM) are often used for the analysis of longitudinal data but their use in these time-resolved immunological data is not common yet. Apart from the modeling challenges mentioned earlier, selection of the optimal model by using information-criterion-based measures is far from being straight-forward. The aim of this study is to provide guidelines for the application and selection of LMMs that deal with the challenging characteristics of the typical data sets in the field of vaccine clinical studies. Methods: We used antibody measurements in response to Hepatitis-B vaccine with five different adjuvant formulations for demonstration purposes. We built piecewise-linear, piecewise-quadratic and cubic models with transformations of the axes with pre-selected or optimized knot locations where time is a numerical variable. We also investigated models where time is categorical and random effects are shared intercepts between different measurement points. We compared all models by using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), Deviance Information Criterion (DIC), variations of conditional AIC and by visual inspection of the model fit in the light of prior biological information. Results: There are various ways of dealing with the challenges of the data which have their own advantages and disadvantages. We explain these in detail here. Traditional information-criteria-based measures work well for the coarse selection of the model structure and complexity, however are not efficient at fine tuning of the complexity level of the random effects. Conclusions: We show that common statistical measures for optimal model complexity are not sufficient.

Patients with sepsis exhibit wide heterogeneity stemming from genetic, molecular, and clinical factors as well as differences in pathogens, creating challenges for the development of effective treatments. Several gaps in knowledge also contribute: (i) biomarkers that identify patients likely to benefit from specific treatments are unknown; (ii) therapeutic dose and duration is often poorly understood; and (iii) short-term mortality, a common outcome measure, is frequently criticized for being insensitive. To date, the majority of sepsis trials use traditional design features, and have largely failed to identify new treatments with incremental benefit over standard of care. Traditional trials are also frequently conducted as part of a drug evaluation process that is segmented into several phases, each requiring separate trials, with a long time delay from inception through design and execution to incorporation of results into clinical practice. By contrast, adaptive clinical trial designs facilitate the evaluation of several candidate treatments simultaneously, learn from emergent discoveries during the course of the trial, and can be structured efficiently to lead to more timely conclusions compared to traditional trial designs. Adoption of new treatments in clinical practice can be accelerated if these trials are incorporated in electronic health records as part of a learning health system.

Traditional paradigms for the MinED studies are conducted as dose-ranging or dose-response trials which involve several doses and randomize patients among doses to find the MinED. An alternative approach for the MinED study is the so-called MinED-based dose-finding study, in which instead of conducting hypothesis testings and without power analysis, this kind of trial conduct dose escalation/de-escalation to target a pre-set MinED target.

METHODS: In an open-label, adaptive platform trial, we randomly assigned hospitalized adults with Covid-19 to low-dose low-molecular-weight heparin thromboprophylaxis or intermediate-dose or low-dose plus aspirin. In response to external evidence, the aspirin intervention was discontinued and a therapeutic-dose arm added. The primary end point was death or the requirement for new organ support by day 28, analyzed with a Bayesian logistic model. Enrolment was closed as a result of operational constraints. RESULTS: Between February 2021 and March 2022, 1574 patients were randomly assigned. Among 1526 participants included in the analysis (India, n=1273; Australia and New Zealand, n=138; and Nepal, n=115), the primary outcome occurred in 35 (5.9%) of 596 in low-dose, 25 (4.2%) of 601 in intermediate-dose, 20 (7.2%) of 279 in low-dose plus aspirin, and 7 (14%) of 50 in therapeutic-dose anticoagulation. Compared with low-dose thromboprophylaxis, the median adjusted odds ratio for the primary outcome for intermediate-dose was 0.74 (95% credible interval [CrI], 0.43 to 1.27; posterior probability of effectiveness [adjusted odds ratio<1; Pr], 86%), for low-dose plus aspirin 0.88 (95% CrI, 0.47 to 1.64; Pr, 65%), and for therapeutic-dose anticoagulation 2.22 (95% CrI, 0.77 to 6.20; Pr, 7%). Overall thrombotic and bleeding rates were 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively. There were 10 serious adverse reactions related to anticoagulation strategy, of which nine were grade 1 or 2 across study interventions and one grade 4 episode of retroperitoneal hematoma in a patient receiving intermediate-dose anticoagulation. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized non–critically ill adults with Covid-19, compared with low-dose, there was an 86% posterior probability that intermediate-dose, 65% posterior probability that low-dose plus aspirin, and a 7% posterior probability that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation reduced the odds of death or requirement for organ support.

Here, we introduce a class of Bayesian response-adaptive designs for factorial clinical trials with binary outcomes. The study design was developed using Bayesian decision-theoretic arguments and adapts the randomization probabilities to treatment combinations during the enrollment period based on the available data. Our approach enables the investigator to specify a utility function representative of the aims of the trial, and the Bayesian response-adaptive randomization algorithm aims to maximize this utility function. We considered several utility functions and factorial designs tailored to them. Then, we conducted a comparative simulation study to illustrate relevant differences of key operating characteristics across the resulting designs. We also investigated the asymptotic behavior of the proposed adaptive designs. We also used data summaries from three recent factorial trials in perioperative care, smoking cessation, and infectious disease prevention to define realistic simulation scenarios and illustrate advantages of the introduced trial designs compared to other study designs.

A latent subgroup membership variable is assumed to allow the design to adaptively combine homogeneous subgroups, or split heterogeneous subgroups, to improve the procedure's within-subgroup power. If a baseline covariate related to survival is available, the design may incorporate this information to improve subgroup identification while basing the comparative test on the average hazard ratio. General guidelines are provided for calibrating prior hyperparameters and design parameters to control the overall Type I error rate and optimize performance. Simulations show that the design is robust under a wide variety of different scenarios. When two or more subgroups are truly homogeneous but differ from the other subgroups, the proposed method is substantially more powerful than tests that either ignore subgroups or conduct a separate test within each subgroup.

In this paper, we aim to describe some evolving concepts associated with the design and conduct of RCTs and outline new approaches aiming to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Recent findings: A well-powered and performed RCT is usually a study involving several different centers from different geographical areas that enrolls a large number of patients in diverse clinical settings. Altogether, these features increase the generalizability of the study and make the rapid implementation of the findings more likely. However, this does not come without cost. Among several possible alternatives to conventional RCTs, the most important ones are related to the unit of randomization (individual vs. cluster), study design (conventional vs. adaptive), randomization scheme (fixed vs. response-adaptive), data collection (conventional case report forms vs. registry-embedded) and statistical approach (frequentist vs. Bayesian). Summary: While conventional RCTs remain the gold standard for generating evidence, new trial designs may be considered to reduce sample size and costs while improving trial efficiency and power. However, they raise new challenges for testing feasibility, conduct, ethical oversight and statistical analysis.",,Y,,,

Motivated by a real clinical trial, this paper considers phase I-II dose finding designs for dual-agent combinations, where one main objective is to characterize both the toxicity and efficacy profiles. We propose a two-stage Bayesian adaptive design that accommodates a change of patient population in-between. In stage I, we estimate a maximum tolerated dose combination using the escalation with overdose control (EWOC) principle. This is followed by a stage II, conducted in a new yet relevant patient population, to find the most efficacious dose combination. We implement a robust Bayesian hierarchical random-effects model to allow sharing of information on the efficacy across stages, assuming that the related parameters are either exchangeable or nonexchangeable. Under the assumption of exchangeability, a random-effects distribution is specified for the main effects parameters to capture uncertainty about the between-stage differences. The inclusion of nonexchangeability assumption further enables that the stage-specific efficacy parameters have their own priors. The proposed methodology is assessed with an extensive simulation study. Our results suggest a general improvement of the operating characteristics for the efficacy assessment, under a conservative assumption about the exchangeability of the parameters a priori.

Selective dismutase mimetics sensitise tumours while reducing normal tissue toxicity. This trial was designed to establish the efficacy and toxicity afforded by the selective dismutase mimetic avasopasem manganese when combined with ablative SBRT for localised pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Methods: In this adaptive, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1b/2 trial, patients aged 18 years or older with borderline resectable or locally advanced pancreatic cancer who had received at least 3 months of chemotherapy and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 were enrolled at six academic sites in the USA. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1), with block randomisation (block sizes of 6-12) with a maximum of 24 patients per group, to receive daily avasopasem (90 mg) or placebo intravenously directly before (ie, within 180 min) SBRT (50, 55, or 60 Gy in five fractions, adaptively assigned in real time by Bayesian estimates of 90-day safety and efficacy). Patients and physicians were masked to treatment group allocation, but not to SBRT dose. The primary objective was to find the optimal dose of SBRT with avasopasem or placebo as determined by the late onset EffTox method. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03340974, and is complete. Findings: Between Jan 25, 2018, and April 29, 2020, 47 patients were screened, of whom 42 were enrolled (median age was 71 years [IQR 63-75], 23 [55%] were male, 19 [45%] were female, 37 [88%] were White, three [7%] were Black, and one [2%] each were unknown or other races) and randomly assigned to avasopasem (n=24) or placebo (n=18); the placebo group was terminated early after failing to meet prespecified efficacy parameters. At data cutoff (June 28, 2021), the avasopasem group satisfied boundaries for both efficacy and toxicity. Late onset EffTox efficacy response was observed in 16 (89%) of 18 patients at 50 Gy and six (100%) of six patients at 55 Gy in the avasopasem group, and was observed in three (50%) of six patients at 50 Gy and nine (75%) of 12 patients at 55 Gy in the placebo group, and the Bayesian model recommended 50 Gy or 55 Gy in five fractions with avasopasem for further study. Serious adverse events of any cause were reported in three (17%) of 18 patients in the placebo group and six (25%) of 24 in the avasopasem group. In the placebo group, grade 3 adverse events within 90 days of SBRT were abdominal pain, acute cholangitis, pyrexia, increased blood lactic acid, and increased lipase (one [6%] each); no grade 4 events occurred. In the avasopasem group, grade 3-4 adverse events within 90 days of SBRT were acute kidney injury, increased blood alkaline phosphatase, haematoma, colitis, gastric obstruction, lung infection, abdominal abscess, post-surgical atrial fibrillation, and pneumonia leading to respiratory failure (one [4%] each).There were no treatment-related deaths but one late death in the avasopasem group due to sepsis in the setting of duodenal obstruction after off-study treatment was reported as potentially related to SBRT. Interpretation: SBRT that uses 50 or 55 Gy in five fractions can be considered for patients with localised pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The addition of avasopasem might further enhance disease outcomes. A larger phase 2 trial (GRECO-2, NCT04698915) is underway to validate these results. Funding: Galera Therapeutics.",NCT03340974,Y,,,

Adaptations can include comparisons of multiple dose tiers, response-adaptive randomization, sample size re-estimation, and efficacy/futility stopping rules. The objective of this scoping review is to assess stakeholder attitudes, perspectives, and understanding of adaptive trials. Methods: We conducted a review of articles examining stakeholders encompassing the broad medical trial community's perspectives of adaptive designs (ADs). A computerized search was conducted of four electronic databases with relevant search terms. Following screening of articles, the primary findings of each included article were coded for study design, population studied, purpose, and primary implications. Results: Our team retrieved 167 peer-reviewed titles in total from the database search and 5 additional titles through searching web-based search engines for gray literature. Of those 172 titles, 152 were non-duplicate citations. Of these, 119 were not given full-text reviews, as their titles and abstracts indicated that they did not meet the inclusion criteria. Thirty-three articles were carefully examined for relevance, and of those, 18 were chosen to be part of the analysis; the other 15 were excluded, as they were not relevant upon closer inspection. Perceived advantages to ADs included limiting ineffective treatments and efficiency in answering the research question; -perceived barriers included insufficient sample size for secondary outcomes, challenges of consent, potential for bias, risk of type 1 error, cost and time to adaptively design trials, unclear rationales for using Ads, and, most importantly, a lack of education regarding ADs among stakeholders within the clinical trial community. Perceptions among different types of stakeholders varied from sector to sector, with patient perspectives being noticeably absent from the literature. Conclusion: There are diverse perceptions regarding ADs among stakeholders. Further training, guidelines, and toolkits on the proper use of ADs are needed at all levels to overcome many of these perceived barriers. While education for principal investigators is important, it is also crucial to educate other groups in the community, such as patients, as well as clinicians and staff involved in their daily implementation.

In the Bayesian framework, allocation probabilities to different treatment arms are commonly defined as functionals of the posterior distributions of parameters of the outcome distribution for each treatment. In a non-conjugate model, however, repeated updates of the posterior distribution can be computationally intensive. In this article, we propose an adaptation of sequential Monte Carlo for efficiently updating the posterior distribution of parameters as new outcomes are observed in a general adaptive trial design. An efficient computational tool facilitates implementation of more flexible designs with more frequent interim looks that can in turn reduce the required sample size and expected number of failures in clinical trials. Moreover, more complex statistical models that reflect realistic modeling assumptions can be used for analysis of trial results.

We advocate Bayesian hierarchical models for response-adaptive randomized phase II studies integrating single or multiple biomarkers. Prior selection allows one to control a gradual and seamless transition from randomized-blocks to marker-enrichment during the trial. Adaptive randomization is an efficient design for evaluating treatment efficacy within biomarker subgroups, with less variable final sample sizes when compared to nested staged designs. Inference based on the Bayesian hierarchical model also has improved performance in identifying the sub-population where therapeutics are effective over independent analyses done within each biomarker subgroup.

Targeted agents, however, do not work for everyone. Hence, the development of target agents requires the evaluation of prognostic and predictive markers. In addition, upon the identification of each patient's marker profile, it is desirable to treat patients with best available treatments in the clinical trial accordingly. Methods: Many designs have recently been proposed for the development of targeted agents. These include the simple randomization design, marker stratified design, marker strategy design, efficient targeted design, etc. In contrast to the frequentist designs with equal randomization, we propose novel Bayesian adaptive randomization designs that allow evaluating treatments and markers simultaneously, while providing more patients with effective treatments according to the patients' marker profiles. Early stopping rules can be implemented to increase the efficiency of the designs. Results: Through simulations, the operating characteristics of different designs are compared and contrasted. By carefully choosing the design parameters, types I and II errors can be controlled for Bayesian designs. By incorporating adaptive randomization and early stopping rules, the proposed designs incorporate rational learning from the interim data to make informed decisions. Bayesian design also provides a formal way to incorporate relevant prior information. Compared with previously published designs, the proposed design can be more efficient, more ethical, and is also more flexible in the study conduct. Limitations: Response adaptive randomization requires the response to be assessed in a relatively short time period. The infrastructure must be set up to allow timely and more frequent monitoring of interim results. Conclusion: Bayesian adaptive randomization designs are distinctively suitable for the development of multiple targeted agents with multiple biomarkers.",,Y,,,

Peptide microarrays tiling immunogenic regions of pathogens (e.g., envelope proteins of a virus) are an important high throughput tool for querying and mapping antibody binding. Because of the assay's many steps, from probe synthesis to incubation, peptide microarray data can be noisy with extreme outliers. In addition, subjects may produce different antibody profiles in response to an identical vaccine stimulus or infection, due to variability among subjects' immune systems. We present a robust Bayesian hierarchical model for peptide microarray experiments, pepBayes, to estimate the probability of antibody response for each subject/peptide combination. Heavy-tailed error distributions accommodate outliers and extreme responses, and tailored random effect terms automatically incorporate technical effects prevalent in the assay. We apply our model to two vaccine trial data sets to demonstrate model performance. Our approach enjoys high sensitivity and specificity when detecting vaccine induced antibody responses. A simulation study shows an adaptive thresholding classification method has appropriate false discovery rate control with high sensitivity, and receiver operating characteristics generated on vaccine trial data suggest that pepBayes clearly separates responses from non-responses.

Available pharmacological treatments are suboptimal for patients, including veterans, with late-life depression. Ketamine has emerged as a potentially promising rapid-acting therapy for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, few studies have examined the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ketamine therapy for older adults with late-life TRD (LL-TRD). This study uses an adaptive randomization design to test the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and durability of three distinct, single sub-anesthetic doses of intravenous (IV) ketamine versus a single dose of active placebo (midazolam) in older depressed veterans. As the study progresses, Bayesian adaptive randomization recalibrates randomization ratios to allocate more participants to conditions demonstrating greater promise and fewer participants to conditions with less promise. Secondary analyses explore clinical and biological moderating and mediating factors of rapid treatment response. Results are expected to inform both the viability of ketamine treatment and optimal dosing strategies for patients with LL-TRD.

In addition, some clinicians and researchers believe that using adaptive randomization leads necessarily to more ethical treatment of subjects in a trial. We develop Bayesian, decision-theoretic, clinical trial designs with response-adaptive randomization and a primary goal of estimating treatment effect and then contrast these designs with designs that also include in their loss function a cost for poor subject outcome. When the loss function did not incorporate a cost for poor subject outcome, the gains in efficiency from response-adaptive randomization were accompanied by ethically concerning subject allocations. Conversely, including a cost for poor subject outcome demonstrated a more acceptable balance between the competing needs in the trial. A subsequent, parallel set of trials designed to control explicitly types I and II error rates showed that much of the improvement achieved through modification of the loss function was essentially negated. Therefore, gains in efficiency from the use of a decision-theoretic, response-adaptive design using adaptive randomization may only be assumed to apply to those goals that are explicitly included in the loss function. Trial goals, including ethical ones, which do not appear in the loss function, are ignored and may even be compromised; it is thus inappropriate to assume that all adaptive trials are necessarily more ethical.

Methods: The Empirical Meropenem versus Piperacillin/Tazobactam for Adult Patients with Sepsis (EMPRESS) trial is an investigator-initiated, international, parallel-group, randomised, open-label, adaptive clinical trial with an integrated feasibility phase. We will randomise adult, critically ill patients with sepsis to empirical treatment with meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam for up to 30 days. The primary outcome is 30-day all-cause mortality. The secondary outcomes are serious adverse reactions within 30 days; isolation precautions due to resistant bacteria within 30 days; days alive without life support and days alive and out of hospital within 30 and 90 days; 90- and 180-day all-cause mortality and 180-day health-related quality of life. EMPRESS will use Bayesian statistical models with weak to somewhat sceptical neutral priors. Adaptive analyses will be conducted after follow-up of the primary outcome for the first 400 participants concludes and after every 300 subsequent participants, with adaptive stopping for superiority/inferiority and practical equivalence (absolute risk difference <2.5%-points) and response-adaptive randomisation. The expected sample sizes in scenarios with no, small or large differences are 5189, 5859 and 2570 participants, with maximum 14,000 participants and ?99% probability of conclusiveness across all scenarios. Conclusions: EMPRESS will compare the effects of empirical meropenem against piperacillin/tazobactam in adult, critically ill patients with sepsis. Due to the pragmatic, adaptive design with high probability of conclusiveness, the trial results are expected to directly inform clinical practice.

A response adaptive trial design enables researchers to use treatment results about earlier patients to aid in treatment decisions of later patients. Optimal adaptive trial designs have been developed without consideration of biomarkers. In this article, we describe the mathematical steps for computing optimal biomarker-integrated adaptive trial designs. These designs maximize the expected trial utility given any pre-specified utility function, though we focus here on maximizing patient responses within a given patient horizon. We describe the performance of the optimal design in different scenarios. We compare it to Bayesian Adaptive Randomization (BAR), which is emerging as a practical approach to develop adaptive trials. The difference in expected utility between BAR and optimal designs is smallest when the biomarker subgroups are highly imbalanced. We also compare BAR, a frequentist play-the-winner rule with integrated biomarkers and a marker-stratified balanced randomization design (BR). We show that, in contrasting two treatments, BR achieves a nearly optimal expected utility when the patient horizon is relatively large. Our work provides novel theoretical solution, as well as an absolute benchmark for the evaluation of trial designs in personalized medicine.

Learning about treatment effectiveness with a view to treat patients in the larger outside population, as in the traditional fixed randomised design, may not be a plausible goal. An alternative goal is to treat the patients within the trial as effectively as possible. Using the framework of finite-horizon Markov decision processes and dynamic programming (DP), a novel randomised response-adaptive design is proposed which maximises the total number of patient successes in the trial and penalises if a minimum number of patients are not recruited to each treatment arm. Several performance measures of the proposed design are evaluated and compared to alternative designs through extensive simulation studies using a recently published trial as motivation. For simplicity, a two-armed trial with binary endpoints and immediate responses is considered. Simulation results for the proposed design show that: (i) the percentage of patients allocated to the superior arm is much higher than in the traditional fixed randomised design; (ii) relative to the optimal DP design, the power is largely improved upon and (iii) it exhibits only a very small bias and mean squared error of the treatment effect estimator. Furthermore, this design is fully randomised which is an advantage from a practical point of view because it protects the trial against various sources of bias. As such, the proposed design addresses some of the key issues that have been suggested as preventing so-called bandit models from being implemented in clinical practice.

METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with previously untreated MDS with low/intermediate-1 risk by the International Prognostic Scoring System with a Bayesian response-adaptive design to receive either 20 mg/m2 decitabine daily or 75 mg/m2 azacitidine daily on days 1 to 3 every 28-day cycle. RESULTS: A total of 113 patients were treated: 73 (65%) with decitabine and 40 (35%) with azacitidine. The overall response rate was 67% and 48% in the decitabine and azacitidine groups, respectively (P=0.042); among 59 patients with baseline transfusion dependency, 19 (32%) reached transfusion independence (decitabine, 16 of 39 [41%]; azacitidine, 3 of 20 [15%]; P=0.039). Of the 19 patients who reached transfusion independence, the median duration of transfusion independency was 22 months. Among 54 patients who were transfusion independent at baseline, 5 patients (9%) became transfusion dependent after therapy. No early death was observed. With a median follow-up of 68 months, the median overall event-free survival and overall survival were 17 months and 33 months, respectively.

The primary objective was to estimate progression-free survival (PFS) after sequential versus combination cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 and programmed death ligand 1 ICIs in patients with platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Methods: Patients were randomized to a sequential arm (tremelimumab followed by durvalumab on progression) or a combination arm (tremelimumab plus durvalumab, followed by durvalumab) via a Bayesian adaptive design that made it more likely for patients to be randomized to the more effective arm. The primary end point was immune-related PFS (irPFS). Results: Sixty-one subjects were randomized to sequential (n = 38) or combination therapy (n = 23). Thirteen patients (34.2%) in the sequential arm received durvalumab. There was no difference in PFS in the sequential arm (1.84 months; 95% CI, 1.77-2.17 months) compared with the combination arm (1.87 months; 95% CI, 1.77-2.43 months) (p = .402). In the sequential arm, no responses were observed, although 12 patients (31.6%) demonstrated stable disease. In the combination arm, two patients (8.7%) had partial response, whereas one patient (4.4%) had stable disease. Adverse events were consistent with those previously reported for ICIs. Patient-reported outcomes were similar in both arms. Conclusions: There was no difference in irPFS for combination tremelimumab plus durvalumab compared to tremelimumab alone (administered as part of a sequential treatment strategy) in a heavily pretreated population of patients with platinum-resistant HGSOC.

Pulmonary exacerbations, or flare-ups of the lung disease, often require hospitalization for intensive treatment. Approximately 25% of patients with cystic fibrosis do not recover their baseline lung function after pulmonary exacerbations. There is a relative paucity of evidence to inform treatment strategies for exacerbations. Compounding this lack of evidence, there are a large number of treatment options already as well as becoming available. This results in significant variability between medication regimens prescribed by different physicians, treatment centers and regions with potentially adverse impact to patients. The conventional strategy is to undertake essential randomized clinical trials to inform treatment decisions and improve outcomes for patients with exacerbations. However, over the past several decades, clinical trials have generally failed to provide information critical to improved treatment and management of exacerbations. Bayesian adaptive platform trials hold the promise of addressing clinical uncertainties and informing treatment. Using modeling and response adaptive randomization, they allow for the evaluation of multiple treatments across different management domains, and progressive improvement in patient outcomes throughout the course of the trial. Bayesian adaptive platform trials require substantial amounts of preparation. Basic preparation includes extensive stakeholder involvement including elicitation of consumer preferences and clinician understanding of the research topic, defining the research questions, determining the best outcome measures, delineating study sub-groups, in depth statistical modeling, designing end-to-end digital solutions seamlessly supporting clinicians, researchers and patients, constructing randomisation algorithms and importantly, defining pre-determined intra-study end-points.

Trebananib was combined with paclitaxel±trastuzumab in the I-SPY2 breast cancer trial. Patients and methods: I-SPY2, a phase II neoadjuvant trial, adaptively randomizes patients with high-risk, early-stage breast cancer to one of several experimental therapies or control based on receptor subtypes as defined by hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 status and MammaPrint risk (MP1, MP2). The primary endpoint is pathologic complete response (pCR). A therapy ""graduates"" if/when it achieves 85% Bayesian probability of success in a phase III trial within a given subtype. Patients received weekly paclitaxel (plus trastuzumab if HER2-positive) without (control) or with weekly intravenous trebananib, followed by doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide and surgery. Pathway-specific biomarkers were assessed for response prediction. Results: There were 134 participants randomized to trebananib and 133 to control. Although trebananib did not graduate in any signature [phase III probabilities: Hazard ratio (HR)-negative (78%), HR-negative/HER2-positive (74%), HR-negative/HER2-negative (77%), and MP2 (79%)], it demonstrated high probability of superior pCR rates over control (92%-99%) among these subtypes. Trebananib improved 3-year event-free survival (HR 0.67), with no significant increase in adverse events. Activation levels of the Tie2 receptor and downstream signaling partners predicted trebananib response in HER2-positive disease; high expression of a CD8 T-cell gene signature predicted response in HR-negative/HER2-negative disease. Conclusions: The angiopoietin (Ang)/Tie2 axis inhibitor trebananib combined with standard neoadjuvant therapy increased estimated pCR rates across HR-negative and MP2 subtypes, with probabilities of superiority >90%. Further study of Ang/Tie2 receptor axis inhibitors in validated, biomarker-predicted sensitive subtypes is warranted.",,Y,,,

More than 80% of patients with AHFS who present to emergency departments are treated identically with intravenous diuretics, despite recognition of the syndrome's heterogeneity. We hypothesize that matching patient profiles with ""personalized"" AHFS treatments will improve outcomes. Matching multiple heterogeneous clinical profiles with a number of potentially effective treatments requires an adaptive trial design that can adjust for these complexities. We propose a Bayesian response-adaptive randomization trial design for AHFS patients. Baseline information collected for each patient with AHFS prior to randomization includes blood pressure, renal function, and dyspnea severity. The primary outcome is discharge readiness within 23h of presentation and no unplanned emergency visits or admissions for acute heart failure within 7days of discharge.

Measurement of neoadjuvant drug effects has also enabled the identification of patients with high risk of distant recurrence and has justified development of additional adjuvant approaches to improve outcomes. Neoadjuvant evaluation of new drugs was significantly improved by the introduction of pathologic complete response (pCR) rate as a quantitative surrogate endpoint for distant disease-free survival (DDFS) and event free survival (EFS). The neoadjuvant phase 2 platform trial I-SPY 2 simultaneously tests multiple drugs across multiple breast cancer subtypes using Bayesian methods of adaptive randomization for assessment of drug efficacy. In addition to the pCR endpoint, the I-SPY 2 trial has demonstrated that the residual cancer burden (RCB) score measures gradations of tumor response that correlate with DDFS and EFS across treatments and subtypes. For HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancers that have failed to attain pCR with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), effective modifications of adjuvant treatment have improved outcomes and changed the standard of care for these subtypes. Neoadjuvant therapy is therefore preferred for stage II and III, as well as some stage I, HER2-positive and triple-negative tumors. Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) strategies have also emerged from innovative trials for stage II and III estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/HER2-negative tumors, as in the ALTERNATE trial. From neoadjuvant trials, opportunities have emerged to de-escalate therapy on the basis of metrics of response to chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. Neoadjuvant therapy for early breast cancer is therefore emerging as a promising approach to accelerate new drug development, optimize treatment strategies, and (where appropriate) de-escalate neoadjuvant therapy.

The mechanism of time-trend impact on BRAR is increasingly being studied but some aspects remain unclear. The goal of this research is to quantify the bias in treatment effect estimation due to the use of BRAR in the presence of time-trend. In addition, simulations are conducted to compare the performance of three commonly used BRAR algorithms under different time-trend patterns with and without early stopping rules. The results demonstrate that using these BRAR methods in a two-arm trial with time-trend may cause type I error inflation and treatment effect estimation bias.

These designs are superior to conventional methods, but implementing them can be challenging. The aim of this article was to describe what we learned while applying a novel Bayesian phase I-II design in a recent trial. Methods: The primary goal of the trial was to optimize radiation therapy (RT) dose among three levels (low, standard, and high), given either with placebo (P) or an investigational agent (A), for treating locally advanced, radiation-naive pancreatic cancer, deemed appropriate for RT rather than surgery. Up to 48 patients were randomly assigned fairly between RT plus P and RT plus A, with RT dose-finding done within each arm using the late-onset efficacy-toxicity design on the basis of two coprimary end points, tumor response and dose-limiting toxicity, both evaluated at up to 90 days. The random assignment was blinded, but within each arm, unblinded RT doses were chosen adaptively using software developed within the institution. Results: Implementing the design involved double-blind balance-restricted random assignment, real-time assessment of patient outcomes to evaluate the efficacy-toxicity trade-off for each RT dose in each arm to optimize each patient's RT dose adaptively, and transition from a single-center trial to a multicenter trial. We present lessons learned and illustrative documentation. Conclusion: Implementing novel Bayesian adaptive trial designs requires close collaborations between physicians, pharmacists, statisticians, data managers, and sponsors. The process is difficult but manageable and essential for efficient trial conduct. Close collaboration during trial conduct is a key component of any trial that includes real-time adaptive decision rules.",,Y,,,

In such cases, Bayesian response-adaptive randomization (BRAR) is often considered because it can alter the allocation ratio throughout the trial in favor of the treatment that is currently performing better. Although previous studies have recommended using fixed randomization over BRAR based on patient benefit metrics calculated from the realized trial sample size, these previous comparisons have been limited by failures to hold type I and II error rates constant across designs or consider the impacts on all individuals directly affected by the design choice. In this paper, we propose a metric for comparing designs with the same type I and II error rates that reflects expected outcomes among individuals who would participate in the trial if enrollment is open when they become eligible. We demonstrate how to use the proposed metric to guide the choice of design in the context of two recent trials in persons suffering out of hospital cardiac arrest.

Increased availability of biomarkers and targeted treatments has led to the need for trial designs that efficiently test new treatments in biomarker-stratified patient subgroups. Methods: We propose a novel Bayesian adaptive randomisation (BAR) design for use in multi-arm phase II trials where biomarkers exist that are potentially predictive of a linked treatment's effect. The design is motivated in part by two phase II trials that are currently in development. The design starts by randomising patients to the control treatment or to experimental treatments that the biomarker profile suggests should be active. At interim analyses, data from treated patients are used to update the allocation probabilities. If the linked treatments are effective, the allocation remains high; if ineffective, the allocation changes over the course of the trial to unlinked treatments that are more effective. Results: Our proposed design has high power to detect treatment effects if the pairings of treatment with biomarker are correct, but also performs well when alternative pairings are true. The design is consistently more powerful than parallel-groups stratified trials. Conclusions: This BAR design is a powerful approach to use when there are pairings of biomarkers with treatments available for testing simultaneously.",,Y,,,

Therefore, we developed a Bayesian adaptive Phase I clinical trial design entitled escalation with overdoing control using normalized equivalent toxicity score for estimating maximum tolerated dose (MTD) contour of two drug combination (EWOC-NETS-COM) used for oncology trials. The normalized equivalent toxicity score (NETS) as the primary endpoint of clinical trial is assumed to follow quasi-Bernoulli distribution and treated as quasi-continuous random variable in the logistic linear regression model which is used to describe the relationship between the doses of the two agents and the toxicity response. Four parameters in the dose-toxicity model were re-parameterized to parameters with explicit clinical meanings to describe the association between NETS and doses of two agents. Noninformative priors were used and Markov chain Monte Carlo was employed to update the posteriors of the four parameters in dose-toxicity model. Extensive simulations were conducted to evaluate the safety, trial efficiency, and MTD estimation accuracy of EWOC-NETS-COM under different scenarios, using the EWOC as reference. The results demonstrated that EWOC-NETS-COM not only efficiently estimates MTD contour of multiple drugs but also provides better trial efficiency by fully utilizing all toxicity information.

In contrast to the traditional computerized adaptive testing setting, which has a well-calibrated item bank with new items added periodically, the online learning system has two unique features: (1) the number of items is large, and they have likely not gone through costly field testing for item calibration; and (2) the individual's ability may change as a result of learning. The Elo rating system has been recognized as an effective method for fast updating of item and person parameters in online learning systems to enable personalized learning. However, the updating parameter in Elo has to be tuned post hoc, and Elo is only suitable for the Rasch model. In this paper, we propose the use of a moment-matching Bayesian update algorithm to estimate item and person parameters on the fly. With sequentially updated item and person parameters, a modified maximum posterior weighted information criterion (MPWI) is proposed to adaptively assign items to individuals. The Bayesian updated algorithm along with MPWI is validated in a simulated multiple-session online learning setting, and the results show that the new combo can achieve fast and reasonably accurate parameter estimations that are comparable to random selection, match-difficulty selection, and traditional online calibration. Moreover, the combo can still function reasonably well with as low as 20% of items being pre-calibrated in the item bank.

Objective: To compare the effects of 4 doses of vitamin D3 supplements on falls. Design: 2-stage Bayesian, response-adaptive, randomized trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02166333). Setting: 2 community-based research units. Participants: 688 participants, aged 70 years and older, with elevated fall risk and a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25-(OH)D] level of 25 to 72.5 nmol/L. Intervention: 200 (control), 1000, 2000, or 4000 IU of vitamin D3 per day. During the dose-finding stage, participants were randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 vitamin D3 doses, and the best noncontrol dose for preventing falls was determined. After dose finding, participants previously assigned to receive noncontrol doses received the best dose, and new enrollees were randomly assigned to receive 200 IU/d or the best dose. Measurements: Time to first fall or death over 2 years (primary outcome). Results: During the dose-finding stage, the primary outcome rates were higher for the 2000- and 4000-IU/d doses than for the 1000-IU/d dose, which was selected as the best dose (posterior probability of being best, 0.90). In the confirmatory stage, event rates were not significantly different between participants with experience receiving the best dose (events and observation time limited to the period they were receiving 1000 IU/d; n = 308) and those randomly assigned to receive 200 IU/d (n = 339) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.94 [95% CI, 0.76 to 1.15]; P = 0.54). Analysis of falls with adverse outcomes suggested greater risk in the experience-with-best-dose group versus the 200-IU/d group (serious fall: HR, 1.87 [CI, 1.03 to 3.41]; fall with hospitalization: HR, 2.48 [CI, 1.13 to 5.46]). Limitations: The control group received 200 IU of vitamin D3 per day, not a placebo. Dose finding ended before the prespecified thresholds for dose suspension and dose selection were reached. Conclusion: In older persons with elevated fall risk and low serum 25-(OH)D levels, vitamin D3 supplementation at doses of 1000 IU/d or higher did not prevent falls compared with 200 IU/d.

Most patients with CSPN have significant pain. Many medications have been tried for pain reduction in CSPN, including antiepileptics, antidepressants, and sodium channel blockers. There are no comparative studies that identify the most effective medication for pain reduction in CSPN. Objective: To determine which medication (pregabalin, duloxetine, nortriptyline, or mexiletine) is most effective for reducing neuropathic pain and best tolerated in patients with CSPN. Design, setting, and participants: From December 1, 2014, through October 20, 2017, a bayesian adaptive, open-label randomized clinical comparative effectiveness study of pain in 402 participants with CSPN was conducted at 40 neurology care clinics. The trial included response adaptive randomization. Participants were patients with CSPN who were 30 years or older, with a pain score of 4 or greater on a numerical rating scale (range, 0-10, with higher scores indicating a higher level of pain). Participant allocation to 1 of 4 drug groups used the utility function and treatment's sample size for response adaptation randomization. At each interim analysis, a decision was made to continue enrolling (up to 400 participants) or stop the whole trial for success (80% power). Patient engagement was maintained throughout the trial, which helped guide the study and identify ways to communicate and disseminate information. Analysis was performed from December 11, 2015, to January 19, 2018. Interventions: Participants were randomized to receive nortriptyline (n = 134), duloxetine (n = 126), pregabalin (n = 73), or mexiletine (n = 69). Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was a utility function that was a composite of the efficacy (participant reported pain reduction of ?50% from baseline to week 12) and quit (participants who discontinued medication) rates. Results: Among the 402 participants (213 men [53.0%]; mean [SD] age, 60.1 [13.4] years; 343 White [85.3%]), the utility function of nortriptyline was 0.81 (95% bayesian credible interval [CrI], 0.69-0.93; 34 of 134 [25.4%] efficacious; and 51 of 134 [38.1%] quit), of duloxetine was 0.80 (95% CrI, 0.68-0.92; 29 of 126 [23.0%] efficacious; and 47 of 126 [37.3%] quit), pregabalin was 0.69 (95% CrI, 0.55-0.84; 11 of 73 [15.1%] efficacious; and 31 of 73 [42.5%] quit), and mexiletine was 0.58 (95% CrI, 0.42-0.75; 14 of 69 [20.3%] efficacious; and 40 of 69 [58.0%] quit). The probability each medication yielded the highest utility was 0.52 for nortriptyline, 0.43 for duloxetine, 0.05 for pregabalin, and 0.00 for mexiletine. Conclusions and relevance: This study found that, although there was no clearly superior medication, nortriptyline and duloxetine outperformed pregabalin and mexiletine when pain reduction and undesirable adverse effects are combined to a single end point.

Widespread mobile phone ownership in Australia could allow automated short message service (SMS) reminders to be used as a low-cost strategy to effectively 'nudge' parents towards vaccinating their children on time. Methods: AuTOMATIC is an adaptive randomised trial which aims to both evaluate and optimise the use of SMS reminders for improving the timely vaccination of children at primary care clinics across Australia. The trial will utilise high levels of digital automation to effect, including eligibility assessment, randomisation, delivery of intervention, data extraction and analysis, thereby allowing healthcare-embedded trial delivery. Up to 10,000 parents attending participating primary care clinics will be randomised to one of 12 different active SMS vaccine reminder content and timing arms or usual practice only (no SMS reminder). The primary outcome is vaccine receipt within 28 days of the scheduled date for the index vaccine (the first scheduled vaccine after randomisation). Secondary analyses will assess receipt and timeliness for all vaccine occasions in all children. Regular scheduled analyses will be performed using Bayesian inference and pre-specified trial decision rules, enabling response adaptive randomisation, suspension of any poorly performing arms and early stopping if a single best message is identified. Discussion: This study will aim to optimise SMS reminders for childhood vaccination in primary care clinics, directly comparing alternative message framing and message timing. We anticipate that the trial will be an exemplar in using Bayesian adaptive methodology to assess a readily implementable strategy in a wide population, capable of delivery due to the levels of digital automation. Methods and findings from this study will help to inform strategies for implementing reminders and embedding analytics in primary health care settings.

In these designs each new treatment assignment depends on previous outcomes through some predefined rule. Here Play-The-Winner (PW), Randomized Play-The-Winner (RPW), Drop-The-Loser, Generalized Drop-the-Loser and Doubly adaptive Biased Coin Designs are considered for new treatment assignments. As frequentist inference relies on complex sampling distributions in those designs, we investigate how Bayesian inference, based on two independent Beta prior distributions, performs from a frequentist point-of-view. Performance is assessed through coverage probabilities of interval estimation procedures, power and minimization of failure count. It is shown that Bayesian inference can be favorably compared to frequentist procedures where the latter are available. The power of response-adaptive designs is generally very close to the power of 1:1 randomized design. However, failure count savings are generally small, except for the PW and Doubly adaptive Biased Coin designs in particular ranges of the true success rates. The RPW assignment rule has the worst performance, while PW, Generalized Drop-the-Loser or Doubly adaptive Biased Coin Designs may outperform other designs depending on different particular ranges of the true success rates.",,Y,,,

Typically, Phase I-II oncology trials take the form of dose-escalation studies, where initial subjects are treated at the lowest dose level and subsequent subjects are treated at progressively higher doses until the optimal dose is identified. While dose-escalation designs are well-motivated in the case of traditional chemotherapeutic agents, an alternate approach may be considered for therapeutic cancer vaccines, where an investigator's main objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a set of dosing schedules or adjuvant combinations rather than to compare the safety and efficacy of progressively higher dose levels. We present a two-stage, Bayesian adaptive Phase I-II trial design to evaluate the safety and efficacy of therapeutic cancer vaccines. In the first stage, we determine whether a vaccination schedule achieves a minimum level of performance by comparing the toxicity and immune response rates to historical benchmarks. Vaccination schedules that achieve a minimum level of performance are compared using their magnitudes of immune response. If the superiority of a single schedule cannot be established after the first stage, Bayesian posterior predictive probabilities are used to determine the additional sample size required to identify the optimal vaccination schedule in a second stage.

Including interim analyses allows the investigator to effectively use the data gathered during the trial. Bayesian adaptive randomization (AR) and multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) designs are two distinct methods that use patient outcomes to improve the efficiency and ethics of the trial. AR allocates a greater proportion of future patients to treatments that have performed well; MAMS designs use pre-specified stopping boundaries to determine whether experimental treatments should be dropped. There is little consensus on which method is more suitable for clinical trials, and so in this paper, we compare the two under several simulation scenarios and in the context of a real multi-arm phase II breast cancer trial. We compare the methods in terms of their efficiency and ethical properties. We also consider the practical problem of a delay between recruitment of patients and assessment of their treatment response. Both methods are more efficient and ethical than a multi-arm trial without interim analyses. Delay between recruitment and response assessment attenuates this efficiency gain. We also consider futility stopping rules for response adaptive trials that add efficiency when all treatments are ineffective. Our comparisons show that AR is more efficient than MAMS designs when there is an effective experimental treatment, whereas if none of the experimental treatments is effective, then MAMS designs slightly outperform AR.

Many promising novel, chemotherapy-free therapies are in development, but few are licensed as their role in current treatment pathways is poorly defined. Methods: The REFRACT trial is an investigator-initiated, UK National Cancer Research Institute, open-label, multi-centre, randomised phase II platform trial aimed at accelerating clinical development of novel therapies by addressing evidence gaps. The first of the three sequential novel therapy arms is epcoritamab plus lenalidomide, to be compared with investigator choice standard therapy (ICT). Patients aged 18 years or older with biopsy proven relapsed or refractory CD20 positive, grade 1-3a follicular lymphoma and assessable disease by PET-CT are eligible. The primary outcome is complete metabolic response by PET-CT at 24 weeks using the Deauville 5-point scale and Lugano 2014 criteria. Secondary outcomes include overall metabolic response, progression-free survival, overall survival, duration of response, and quality of life assessed by EQ-5D-5 L and FACT-Lym. The trial employs an innovative Bayesian design with a target sample size of 284 patients: 95 in the ICT arm and 189 in the novel therapy arms. Discussion: Whilst there are many promising novel drugs in early clinical development for rrFL, understanding the relative efficacy and safety of these agents, and their place in modern treatment pathways, is limited by a lack of randomised trials and dearth of published outcomes for standard regimens to act as historic controls. Therefore, the aim of REFRACT is to provide an efficient platform to evaluate novel agents against standard therapies for rrFL.

Many current methods for analyzing the data at the time of the interim analysis only use the data from patients who have completed the study. Therefore, data collected at intermediate time points are not used for decision making in these studies. However, in some disease areas such as diabetes and obesity, patients may need to be studied for several weeks or months for a drug effect to emerge. Additionally, slow enrollment rates can limit the number of patients who complete the study in a given period of time. Consequently, at the time of an interim analysis, there may be only a small proportion (e.g., 20%) of patients who have completed the study. In this paper, we propose a new Bayesian prediction model to incorporate all the data (from patients who have completed the study and those who have not completed) to make decisions about the study at the interim analysis. Examples of decisions made at the interim analysis include adaptive treatment allocation, dropping nonefficacious dose arms, stopping the study for positive efficacy, and stopping the study for futility. The model is able to handle incomplete longitudinal data including missing data considered missing at random (MAR). A utility-function-based decision rule is also discussed. The benefit of our new method is demonstrated through trial simulations. Three scenarios are examined, and the simulation results demonstrate that this new method outperforms traditional design with the same sample size in each of these scenarios.",,Y,,,

Ensuring these studies are well-powered is crucial for identifying superior treatments. With the rise of personalized medicine, treatment efficacy may vary based on biomarker profiles. However, researchers often lack prior knowledge about which biomarkers are linked to varied treatment effects. Fixed or response-adaptive designs may not sufficiently account for heterogeneous patient characteristics, such as genetic diversity, potentially reducing the chance of selecting the optimal treatment for individuals. Recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric modeling pave the way for innovative trial designs that not only maintain robust power but also offer the flexibility to identify subgroups deriving greater benefits from specific treatments. Building on this inspiration, we introduce a Bayesian adaptive design for multi-arm trials focusing on time-to-event endpoints. We introduce a covariate-adjusted response adaptive randomization, updating treatment allocation probabilities grounded on causal effect estimates using a random intercept accelerated failure time BART model. After the trial concludes, we suggest employing a multi-response decision tree to pinpoint subgroups with varying treatment impacts. The performance of our design is then assessed via comprehensive simulations.

The I-SPY 2 trial, a multicenter, adaptive phase 2 trial of neoadjuvant therapy for high-risk clinical stage II or III breast cancer, evaluated multiple new agents added to standard chemotherapy to assess the effects on rates of pathological complete response (i.e., absence of residual cancer in the breast or lymph nodes at the time of surgery). Methods: We used adaptive randomization to compare standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus the tyrosine kinase inhibitor neratinib with control. Eligible women were categorized according to eight biomarker subtypes on the basis of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, hormone-receptor status, and risk according to a 70-gene profile. Neratinib was evaluated against control with regard to 10 biomarker signatures (prospectively defined combinations of subtypes). The primary end point was pathological complete response. Volume changes on serial magnetic resonance imaging were used to assess the likelihood of such a response in each patient. Adaptive assignment to experimental groups within each disease subtype was based on Bayesian probabilities of the superiority of the treatment over control. Enrollment in the experimental group was stopped when the 85% Bayesian predictive probability of success in a confirmatory phase 3 trial of neoadjuvant therapy reached a prespecified threshold for any biomarker signature (""graduation""). Enrollment was stopped for futility if the probability fell to below 10% for every biomarker signature. Results: Neratinib reached the prespecified efficacy threshold with regard to the HER2-positive, hormone-receptor-negative signature. Among patients with HER2-positive, hormone-receptor-negative cancer, the mean estimated rate of pathological complete response was 56% (95% Bayesian probability interval [PI], 37 to 73%) among 115 patients in the neratinib group, as compared with 33% among 78 controls (95% PI, 11 to 54%). The final predictive probability of success in phase 3 testing was 79%. Conclusions: Neratinib added to standard therapy was highly likely to result in higher rates of pathological complete response than standard chemotherapy with trastuzumab among patients with HER2-positive, hormone-receptor-negative breast cancer.

However three issues remain unclear to investigators: 1) among several BRAR algorithms, how to choose one for the specific trial setting; 2) when to start and how frequently to update the allocation ratio; and 3) how to choose the interim analyses stopping boundaries to preserve the type 1 error. In this paper, three commonly used BRAR algorithms are evaluated based on type 1 error, power, sample size, the proportion of subjects assigned to the better performing arm, and the total number of failures, under two specific trial settings and different allocation ratio update timing and frequencies. Simulation studies show that for two-arm superiority trials, none of the three BRAR algorithms has predominant benefits in both patient ethics and trial efficiency when compared to fixed equal allocation design. For a specific trial aiming to identify the best or the worst among three treatments, a properly selected BRAR algorithm and its implementation parameters are able to gain ethical and efficiency benefits simultaneously.

We investigated novel phase IIc and seamless phase II/III trials utilizing multi-arm multi-stage and Bayesian response adaptive randomization trial designs to select promising combination regimens in a platform adaptive trial. Methods: Clinical trial simulation tools were built using predictive and validated parametric survival models of time to culture conversion (intermediate endpoint) and time to TB-related unfavorable outcome (final endpoint). This integrative clinical trial simulation tool was used to explore and optimize design parameters for aforementioned trial designs. Results: Both multi-arm multi-stage and Bayesian response adaptive randomization designs were able to reliably graduate desirable regimens in ? 95% of trial simulations and reliably stop suboptimal regimens in ? 90% of trial simulations. Overall, adaptive phase IIc designs reduced patient enrollment by 17% and 25% with multi-arm multi-stage and Bayesian response adaptive randomization designs respectively compared to the conventional sequential approach, while seamless designs reduced study duration by 2.6 and 3.5 years respectively (typically ? 8.5 years for standard sequential approach). Conclusions: In this study, we demonstrate that adaptive trial designs are suitable for TB regimen development, and we provide plausible design parameters for a platform adaptive trial. Ultimately trial design and specification of design parameters will depend on clinical trial objectives. To support decision-making for clinical trial designs in contemporary TB regimen development, we provide a flexible clinical trial simulation tool that can be used to explore and optimize design features and parameters.

We designed I-SPY 2, a phase 2, multicenter, adaptively randomized trial to screen multiple experimental regimens in combination with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. The goal is to match experimental regimens with responding cancer subtypes. We report results for veliparib, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, combined with carboplatin. Methods: In this ongoing trial, women are eligible for participation if they have stage II or III breast cancer with a tumor 2.5 cm or larger in diameter; cancers are categorized into eight biomarker subtypes on the basis of status with regard to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), hormone receptors, and a 70-gene assay. Patients undergo adaptive randomization within each biomarker subtype to receive regimens that have better performance than the standard therapy. Regimens are evaluated within 10 biomarker signatures (i.e., prospectively defined combinations of biomarker subtypes). Veliparib-carboplatin plus standard therapy was considered for HER2-negative tumors and was therefore evaluated in 3 signatures. The primary end point is pathological complete response. Tumor volume changes measured by magnetic resonance imaging during treatment are used to predict whether a patient will have a pathological complete response. Regimens move on from phase 2 if and when they have a high Bayesian predictive probability of success in a subsequent phase 3 neoadjuvant trial within the biomarker signature in which they performed well. Results: With regard to triple-negative breast cancer, veliparib-carboplatin had an 88% predicted probability of success in a phase 3 trial. A total of 72 patients were randomly assigned to receive veliparib-carboplatin, and 44 patients were concurrently assigned to receive control therapy; at the completion of chemotherapy, the estimated rates of pathological complete response in the triple-negative population were 51% (95% Bayesian probability interval [PI], 36 to 66%) in the veliparib-carboplatin group versus 26% (95% PI, 9 to 43%) in the control group. The toxicity of veliparib-carboplatin was greater than that of the control. Conclusions: The process used in our trial showed that veliparib-carboplatin added to standard therapy resulted in higher rates of pathological complete response than standard therapy alone specifically in triple-negative breast cancer.

This secondary analysis aimed to examine the effects of vitamin D supplementation on frailty using data from the Study To Understand Fall Reduction and Vitamin D in You (STURDY). Methods: The STURDY trial, a two-stage Bayesian, response-adaptive, randomized controlled trial, enrolled 688 community-dwelling adults aged ? 70 years with a low serum 25(OH)D level (10-29 ng/mL) and elevated fall risk. Participants were initially randomized to 200 IU/d (control dose; n = 339) or a higher dose (1000 IU/d, 2000 IU/d, or 4000 IU/d; n = 349) of vitamin D3. Once the 1000 IU/d was selected as the best higher dose, other higher dose groups were reassigned to the 1000 IU/d group and new enrollees were randomized 1:1 to 1000 IU/d or control group. Data were collected at baseline, 3, 12, and 24 months. Frailty phenotype was based on number of the following conditions: unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, slowness, low activity, and weakness (? 3 conditions as frail, 1 or 2 as pre-frail, and 0 as robust). Cox proportional hazard models estimated the risk of developing frailty, or improving or worsening frailty status at follow-up. All models were adjusted for demographics, health conditions, and further stratified by baseline serum 25(OH)D level (insufficiency (20-29 ng/mL) vs. deficiency (10-19 ng/mL)). Results: Among 687 participants (mean age 77.1 ± 5.4, 44% women) with frailty assessment at baseline, 208 (30%) were robust, 402 (59%) were pre-frail, and 77 (11%) were frail. Overall, there was no significant difference in risk of frailty outcomes comparing the pooled higher doses (PHD; ? 1000 IU/d) vs. 200 IU/d. When comparing each higher dose vs. 200 IU/d, the 2000 IU/d group had nearly double the risk of worsening frailty status (HR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.13-3.16), while the 4000 IU/d group had a lower risk of developing frailty (HR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.05-0.97). There were no significant associations between vitamin D doses and frailty status in the analyses stratified by baseline serum 25(OH)D level.

We investigated our hypothesis that HMB reflects impaired endometrial vasoconstriction due to endometrial glucocorticoid deficiency. Does reversing this deficiency, by short-term luteal-phase treatment with exogenous glucocorticoid (dexamethasone), ameliorate HMB? Methods: In our Bayesian response-adaptive parallel-group placebo-controlled randomised trial, five pre-planned interim analyses used primary outcome data to adjust randomisation probabilities to favour doses providing most dose-response information. Participants with HMB, recruited from Lothian (Scotland) NHS clinics and via community invitations/advertisements, were aged over 18 years; reported regular 21-42 day menstrual cycles; and had measured menstrual blood loss (MBL) averaging ? 50 mL over two screening periods. Identically encapsulated placebo, or one of six Dexamethasone doses (0·2 mg, 0·4 mg, 0·5 mg, 0·6 mg, 0·75 mg, 0·9 mg), were taken orally twice-daily over five days in the mid-luteal phase of three menstrual cycles. Participants, investigators, and those measuring outcomes were masked to group assignment. Primary outcome, change in average MBL from screening to 'treatment', was analysed by allocated treatment, for all with data. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01769820; EudractCT 2012-003,405-98 FINDINGS: Recruitment lasted 29/01/2014 to 25/09/2017; 176 were screened, 107 randomised and 97 provided primary outcome data (n = 24,5,9,21,8,14,16 in the seven arms, placebo to 1·8 mg total daily active dose). In Bayesian normal dynamic linear modelling, 1·8 mg dexamethasone daily showed a 25 mL greater reduction in MBL from screening, than placebo (95% credible interval 1 to 49 mL), and probability 0·98 of benefit over placebo. Adverse events were reported by 75% (58/77) receiving dexamethasone, 58% (15/26) taking placebo. Three serious adverse events occurred, two during screening, one in a placebo participant.

Conventional group-sequential multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) designs use pre-specified stopping boundaries and treatment selection rules to determine if experimental treatments should be dropped. Flexible MAMS designs allow for interim modifications to the design plan without compromising error rates. Bayesian response adaptive randomization (BRAR) designs increase patient allocation to treatment arms that are performing well during the course of the trial. In this paper, we compare these two major methods and their extensions under several scenarios in the platform trials setting. Results show that BRAR and flexible MAMS designs have comparable power and type 1 error rate under varying simulated scenarios, allowing for addition of flexible treatment selection. BRAR outperforms flexible MAMS when there is a single effective treatment. Flexible MAMS designs are more efficient compared to BRAR when there are no effective treatments. BRAR performance increases as the probability of a treatment arm being dropped increases.

In neurophysiology experiments, information about external stimuli or behavioral tasks has been frequently characterized in term of neuronal firing rate. The firing rate is conventionally estimated by averaging spiking responses across multiple similar experiments (or trials). However, there exist a number of applications in neuroscience research that require firing rate to be estimated on a single trial basis. Estimating firing rate from a single trial is a challenging problem and current state-of-the-art methods do not perform well. To address this issue, we develop a new method for estimating firing rate based on a kernel smoothing technique that considers the bandwidth as a random variable with prior distribution that is adaptively updated under an empirical Bayesian framework. By carefully selecting the prior distribution together with Gaussian kernel function, an analytical expression can be achieved for the kernel bandwidth. We refer to the proposed method as Bayesian Adaptive Kernel Smoother (BAKS). We evaluate the performance of BAKS using synthetic spike train data generated by biologically plausible models: inhomogeneous Gamma (IG) and inhomogeneous inverse Gaussian (IIG). We also apply BAKS to real spike train data from non-human primate (NHP) motor and visual cortex. We benchmark the proposed method against established and previously reported methods. These include: optimized kernel smoother (OKS), variable kernel smoother (VKS), local polynomial fit (Locfit), and Bayesian adaptive regression splines (BARS). Results using both synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance compared to competing methods. This suggests that the proposed method could be useful for understanding the encoding mechanism of neurons in cognitive-related tasks. The proposed method could also potentially improve the performance of brain-machine interface (BMI) decoder that relies on estimated firing rate as the input.",,Y,,,

Holding the promise of treating more patients with the better treatments, RARs have been successfully implemented in clinical trials. We compared equal randomization (ER) with three RARs: Bayesian adaptive randomization, sequential maximum likelihood, and sequential posterior mean. We fixed the total number of patients, considered as patient horizon, but varied the number of patients in the trial. Among the designs, we compared the proportion of patients assigned to the superior arm, overall response rate, statistical power, and total patients enrolled in the trial with and without adding an efficacy early stopping rule. Without early stopping, ER is preferred when the number of patients beyond the trial is much larger than the number of patients in the trial. RAR is favored for large treatment difference or when the number of patients beyond the trial is small. With early stopping, the difference between these two types of designs was reduced. By carefully choosing the design parameters, both RAR and ER methods can achieve the desirable statistical properties. Within three RAR methods, we recommend SPM considering the larger proportion in the better arm and higher overall response rate than BAR and similar power and trial size with ER. The ultimate choice of RAR or ER methods depends on the investigator's preference, the trade-off between group ethics and individual ethics, and logistic considerations in the trial conduct, etc. Keywords: Allocation probability; Bayesian adaptive design; Efficacy early stopping; Operating characteristics; Patient horizon.",,Y,,,

We report the design, implementation, and outcome of an innovative Bayesian, response-adaptive, dose-ranging trial of an investigational drug in patients with diabetes, incorporating a dose expansion approach to flexibly address both efficacy and safety. Purpose: The design was developed to assess whether one or more doses of an investigational drug demonstrated superior efficacy to an active control while maintaining an acceptable safety profile. Methods: The trial used a two-stage design, in which patients were initially allocated equally to placebo, investigational drug at a low and a medium dose, and an active control. Movement to the second stage was contingent upon evidence of efficacy (measured by change in fasting blood glucose) to add a very low dose of the investigational drug and of safety (measured by weight gain) to add a high dose of the investigational drug. The design incorporated a longitudinal model to maximize use of incomplete data, predictive probabilities to guide the decisions to terminate the trial for futility or move on to Stage 2, and a dose-response model in Stage 2 to borrow information across adjacent doses. Extensive simulations were used to fine tune trial parameters, to define operating characteristics, and to determine the required sample sizes. A data monitoring committee was provided with frequent reports to aid in trial oversight. Results: In Stage 1, as trial data accrued, the predictive probability that either the low or medium dose of the investigational drug was superior to the active control fell to low values. Stage 1 termination was recommended after 199 subjects were randomized, out of a maximum trial size of 500 subjects, and the final sample size was 218. Thus the trial did not progress to Stage 2. Limitations: Because of the relatively narrow dose range to be assessed, and the inability to utilize the highest dose at the beginning of the trial, a fully responsive-adaptive design incorporating dose-response modeling was not considered a viable option. This limited the efficiency gains possible with a full set of adaptive design elements. Conclusions: The two-stage dose-expansion design functioned as designed, recommending early termination based on a low probability that the tested doses had efficacy greater than the active control.",,Y,,,

In the present work, we propose a two-stage Bayesian adaptive design for a Phase IIb study aimed at selecting the lowest effective dose for Phase III. In this setting, efficacy has been proved for a high dose in a Phase IIa proof-of-concept study, but the existence of a lower but still effective dose is investigated before the scheduled Phase III starts. In the first stage, we randomize patients to placebo, maximal tolerated dose, and one or more additional doses within the dose range. Based on an interim analysis, we either stop the study for futility or success or continue the study to the second stage, where newly recruited patients are allocated to placebo, some fairly high dose, and one additional dose chosen based on interim data. At the interim analysis, we use the criteria based on the predictive probability of success to decide on whether to stop or to continue the trial and, in the latter case, which dose to select for the second stage. Finally, we will select a dose as lowest effective dose for Phase III either at the end of the first stage or at the end of the second stage. We evaluate the operating characteristics of the procedure via simulations and present the results for several scenarios, comparing the performance of the proposed procedure to those of the non-adaptive design.

The goal of this study was to identify the best dose to carry forward into a larger clinical trial. Response durability at day 28, safety and tolerability, and effects on cortical excitation/inhibition (E/I) ratio using resting electroencephalography gamma and alpha power, were also determined. Thirty-three medication-free US military veterans (mean age 62; range: 55-72; 10 female) with LL-TRD were randomized double-blind. The trial was terminated when dose superiority was established. All interventions were safe and well-tolerated. Pre-specified decision rules terminated KET 0.1 (N = 4) and KET 0.25 (N = 5) for inferiority. Posterior probability was 0.89 that day-seven treatment response was superior for KET 0.5 (N = 11; response rate = 70%) compared to MID (N = 13; response rate = 46%). Persistent treatment response at day 28 was superior for KET 0.5 (response rate = 82%) compared to MID (response rate = 37%). KET 0.5 had high posterior probability of increased frontal gamma power (posterior probability = 0.99) and decreased posterior alpha power (0.89) during infusion, suggesting an acute increase in E/I ratio.

In the era of personalized medicine, it is critical to incorporate the patients' characteristics and improve the clinical benefit for patients. The patients' characteristics are incorporated in adaptive randomization to identify patients who are expected to get more benefit from the treatment and optimize the treatment allocation. However, it is challenging to control potential selection bias from using observed efficacy data and the effect of prognostic covariates in adaptive randomization. This paper proposes a personalized risk-based screening design using Bayesian covariate-adjusted response-adaptive randomization that compares the experimental screening method to a standard screening method based on indicators of having a disease. Personalized risk-based allocation probability is built for adaptive randomization, and Bayesian adaptive decision rules are calibrated to preserve error rates. A simulation study shows that the proposed design controls error rates and yields a much smaller number of failures and a larger number of patients allocated to a better intervention compared to existing randomized controlled trial designs. Therefore, the proposed design performs well for randomized controlled clinical trials under personalized medicine.

Adaptive decisions, such as pre-planned variations of the randomization probabilities, attempt to accelerate the development of new treatments. The design of response adaptive trials, in most cases, requires time consuming simulation studies to describe operating characteristics, such as type I/II error rates, across plausible scenarios. We investigate large sample approximations of pivotal operating characteristics in Bayesian Uncertainty directed trial Designs (BUDs).

A power transformation (PT) is applied to refine the randomization probability. The clip method is used to bound the randomization probability within specified limits. A burn-in period of equal randomization (ER) can be added before adaptive randomization (AR). For each method, more patients are assigned to the superior arm and overall response rate increase as the scheme approximates simple AR, while statistical power increases as it approximates ER. We evaluate the performance of the three methods by varying the tuning parameter to control the extent of AR to achieve the same statistical power. When there is no early stopping rule, PT method generally performed the best in yielding higher proportion to the superior arm and higher overall response rate, but with larger variability. The burn-in method showed smallest variability compared with the clip method and the PT method. With the efficacy early stopping rule, all three methods performed more similarly. The PT and clip methods are better than the burn-in method in achieving higher proportion randomized to the superior arm and higher overall response rate but burn-in method required fewer patients in the trial. By carefully choosing the method and the tuning parameter, RAR methods can be tailored to strike a balance between achieving the desired statistical power and enhancing the overall response rate.

Its recent success has led to generation of novel immunotherapeutic agents that need to be evaluated in clinical trials. Two unique features of immunotherapy are the immune response and the fact that some patients may achieve long-term durable response. In this article, we propose a two-arm Bayesian adaptive randomized phase II clinical trial design for immunotherapy that jointly models the longitudinal immune response and time-to-event efficacy (BILITE), with a fraction of patients assumed to be cured by the treatment. The longitudinal immune response is modeled using hierarchical nonlinear mixed-effects models with possibly different trajectory patterns for the cured and susceptible groups. Conditional on the immune response trajectory, the time-to-event efficacy data for patients in the susceptible group is modeled via a time-dependent Cox-type regression model. We quantify the desirability of the treatment using a utility function and propose a two-stage design to adaptively randomize patients to treatments and make treatment recommendations at the end of the trial. Simulation studies show that compared with a conventional design that ignores the immune response, BILITE yields superior operating characteristics in terms of the ability to identify promising agents and terminate the trial early for futility.

The design of clinical trials is crucial for evaluating safety, confirming effectiveness, and affirming the clinical advantage of novel agents, with the goal of approval by regulatory authorities to expand patient treatment options. Given some challenges unique to brain tumors, early-stage clinical trials for novel targeted agents must integrate pharmacokinetics and tissue-based pharmacodynamic assessments to establish timely go-no-go decisions for larger studies. Surgical window-of-opportunity trials can allow for the comparison of treated and untreated tumor samples, verifying target engagement and its modulatory effects for evidence of biological activity. Due to the challenges of achieving the required sample sizes to power efficacy analyses, later-stage trials of targeted therapies can include basket trials which test one drug on multiple tumor types, while umbrella trials evaluate several biomarkers within a single histology. Platform trials can also be leveraged to investigate multiple biomarker-driven hypotheses within a unified protocol and can incorporate Bayesian algorithms for adaptive randomization. Selecting appropriate endpoints, such as progression-free survival or overall response rate, is crucial and novel response assessment criteria need to be considered in the context of the tumor and therapy being investigated. Lastly, inclusivity in trials is essential to address health disparities and engage diverse patient populations to ensure real-world impact. Future trials should build upon the knowledge gained from both initial achievements and past setbacks in the field.

Hypercoagulability, thrombosis and hyperinflammation occur in COVID-19 and may contribute to severe complications. Therapeutic anticoagulation may improve clinical outcomes through anti-thrombotic, anti-inflammatory and anti-viral mechanisms. Our primary objective is to evaluate whether therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin prevents mechanical ventilation and/or death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to usual care. Methods: An international, open-label, adaptive randomized controlled trial. Using a Bayesian framework, the trial will declare results as soon as pre-specified posterior probabilities for superiority, futility, or harm are reached. The trial uses response-adaptive randomization to maximize the probability that patients will receive the more beneficial treatment approach, as treatment effect information accumulates within the trial. By leveraging a common data safety monitoring board and pooling data with a second similar international Bayesian adaptive trial (REMAP-COVID anticoagulation domain), treatment efficacy and safety will be evaluated as efficiently as possible. The primary outcome is an ordinal endpoint with three possible outcomes based on the worst status of each patient through day 30: no requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation or death. Conclusion: Using an adaptive trial design, the Anti-Thrombotic Therapy To Ameliorate Complications of COVID-19 trial will establish whether therapeutic anticoagulation can reduce mortality and/or avoid the need for mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

These studies must provide clear information to the project teams to enable decision making about further developing a drug candidate but also to gain evidence that any effect size is sufficient to warrant this development given the current market environment. Our case study outlines one such proof of concept trial where a new candidate therapy for neuropathic pain was investigated to assess dose-response and to evaluate the magnitude of its effect compared to placebo. A Normal Dynamic Linear Model was used to estimate the dose-response--enforcing some smoothness in the dose-response, but allowing for the fact that the dose-response may be non-monotonic. A pragmatic, parallel group study design was used with interim analyses scheduled to allow the sponsor to drop ineffective doses or to stop the study. Simulations were performed to assess the operating characteristics of the study design. The study results are presented.

Phase 3 risk can be mitigated by ensuring that clinical efficacy is established before initiating confirmatory trials, but traditional phase 2 trials in AD can be lengthy and costly. Methods: We designed a Bayesian adaptive phase 2, proof-of-concept trial with a clinical endpoint to evaluate BAN2401, a monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid protofibrils. The study design used dose response and longitudinal modeling. Simulations were used to refine study design features to achieve optimal operating characteristics. Results: The study design includes five active treatment arms plus placebo, a clinical outcome, 12-month primary endpoint, and a maximum sample size of 800. The average overall probability of success is ?80% when at least one dose shows a treatment effect that would be considered clinically meaningful. Using frequent interim analyses, the randomization ratios are adapted based on the clinical endpoint, and the trial can be stopped for success or futility before full enrollment. Discussion: Bayesian statistics can enhance the efficiency of analyzing the study data. The adaptive randomization generates more data on doses that appear to be more efficacious, which can improve dose selection for phase 3. The interim analyses permit stopping as soon as a predefined signal is detected, which can accelerate decision making. Both features can reduce the size and duration of the trial. This study design can mitigate some of the risks associated with advancing to phase 3 in the absence of data demonstrating clinical efficacy. Limitations to the approach are discussed.

However, the adaptive platform trial (APT) methodology has not been widely adopted in clinical research on vaccines. Methods: The VACCELERATE Consortium organized a two-day workshop to discuss the applicability of APT methodology in vaccine trials under non-pandemic as well as pandemic conditions. Core aspects of the discussions are summarized in this article. Results: An ""ever-warm"" APT appears ideally suited to improve efficiency and speed of vaccine research. Continuous learning based on accumulating APT trial data allows for pre-planned adaptations during its course. Given the relative design complexity, alignment of all stakeholders at all stages of an APT is central. Vaccine trial modelling is crucial, both before and in a pandemic emergency. Various inferential paradigms are possible (frequentist, likelihood, or Bayesian). The focus in the interpandemic interval may be on research gaps left by industry trials. For activation in emergency, template Disease X protocols of syndromal design for pathogens yet unknown need to be stockpiled and updated regularly. Governance of a vaccine APT should be fully integrated into supranational pandemic response mechanisms. Discussion: A broad range of adaptive features can be applied in platform trials on vaccines. Faster knowledge generation comes with increased complexity of trial design. Design complexity should not preclude simple execution at trial sites. Continuously generated evidence represents a return on investment that will garner societal support for sustainable funding.

With regulatory support, many drug developers have spent a lot of resources on the operationalization of innovative clinical trial designs, for example, adaptive Bayesian designs in confirmatory clinical trial settings. While overall survival is considered the gold standard in these designs, it is often not a viable choice in identifying treatment efficacy at a reasonable pace, especially for early-stage therapies. In recent years, several binary response surrogate endpoints have been used for accelerated or conditional approval of novel cancer therapies. Utilizing surrogate endpoints in the study design to predict objective clinical outcomes, such as overall survival, is particularly fundamental in cancer treatment clinical development. This manuscript will investigate logistic and statistical considerations of our proposed RESTART design, a new two-stage, seamless, single- to double-arm Bayesian design.

This provides challenges for evidence generation to support HTA, so novel research methods are required. Methods: Discussion with an expert panel was augmented with references and case studies to explore robust approaches for HTA evidence generation for rare disease treatments. Results: Traditional RCTs can be modified using sequential, three-stage or adaptive designs to gain more power from a small patient population or to focus trial design. However, such designs need to maintain important design aspects such as randomization and blinding and be analyzed to take account of the multiple analyses performed. N-of-1 trials use within-patient randomization to test repeat periods of treatment and control until a response is clear. Such trials could be particularly valuable for rare diseases and when prospectively planned across several patients and analyzed using Bayesian techniques, a population effect can be estimated that might be of value to HTA. When the optimal outcome is unclear in a rare disease, disease specific patient reported outcomes can elucidate impacts on patients' functioning and wellbeing. Likewise, qualitative research can be used to elicit patients' perspectives, with just a small number of patients.

Its development was originally motivated by the problem of optimal patient allocation in multi-arm clinical trials. However, it has never been used in practice, possibly for the following reasons: (1) it is fully sequential, i.e., the endpoint must be observable soon after treating a patient, reducing the medical settings to which it is applicable; (2) it is completely deterministic and thus removes randomization from the trial, which would naturally protect against various sources of bias. We propose a novel implementation of the Gittins index rule that overcomes these difficulties, trading off a small deviation from optimality for a fully randomized, adaptive group allocation procedure which offers substantial improvements in terms of patient benefit, especially relevant for small populations. We report the operating characteristics of our approach compared to existing methods of adaptive randomization using a recently published trial as motivation.

This article, derived from the ""AKI"" session of the ""Kidney Disease Clinical Trialists"" virtual workshop held in October 2021, reviews barriers to and strategies for improving the design and implementation of clinical trials in patients with, or at risk of, developing AKI. The novel approaches to trial design included in this review span adaptive trial designs that increase the knowledge gained from each trial participant; pragmatic trial designs that allow for the efficient enrollment of sufficiently large numbers of patients to detect small, but clinically significant, treatment effects; and platform trial designs that use one trial infrastructure to answer multiple clinical questions simultaneously. This review also covers novel approaches to clinical trial analysis, such as Bayesian analysis and assessing heterogeneity in the response to therapies among trial participants. We also propose a road map and actionable recommendations to facilitate the adoption of the reviewed approaches. We hope that the resulting road map will help guide future clinical trial planning, maximize learning from AKI trials, and reduce the risk of missing important signals of benefit (or harm) from trial interventions.

However, there is a lack of high-level evidence for many ERP elements. We have designed a randomised, embedded, multifactorial, adaptive platform perioperative medicine (REMAP Periop) trial to evaluate the effectiveness of several perioperative therapies for patients undergoing complex abdominal surgery as part of an ERP. This trial will begin with two domains: postoperative nausea/vomiting (PONV) prophylaxis and regional/neuraxial analgesia. Patients enrolled in the trial will be randomised to arms within both domains, with the possibility of adding additional domains in the future. Methods and analysis: In the PONV domain, patients are randomised to optimal versus supraoptimal prophylactic regimens. In the regional/neuraxial domain, patients are randomised to one of five different single-injection techniques/combination of techniques. The primary study endpoint is hospital-free days at 30 days, with additional domain-specific secondary endpoints of PONV incidence and postoperative opioid consumption. The efficacy of an intervention arm within a given domain will be evaluated at regular interim analyses using Bayesian statistical analysis. At the beginning of the trial, participants will have an equal probability of being allocated to any given intervention within a domain (ie, simple 1:1 randomisation), with response adaptive randomisation guiding changes to allocation ratios after interim analyses when applicable based on prespecified statistical triggers. Triggers met at interim analysis may also result in intervention dropping. Ethics and dissemination: The core protocol and domain-specific appendices were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board.

If radiotherapy is involved, the competing risk issue often arises because the time to disease progression can be censored by the time to normal tissue complications, and vice versa. Besides, many existing research has examined that patients receiving the same radiotherapy dose may yield distinct responses due to their heterogeneous radiation susceptibility statuses. Therefore, the ""one-size-fits-all"" strategy often fails, and it is more relevant to evaluate the subgroup-specific treatment effect with the subgroup defined by the radiation susceptibility status. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian adaptive biomarker stratified phase II trial design evaluating the subgroup-specific treatment effects of radiotherapy. We use the cause-specific hazard approach to model the competing risk survival outcomes. We propose restricting the candidate radiation doses based on each patient's radiation susceptibility status. Only the clinically feasible personalized dose will be considered, which enhances the benefit for the patients in the trial. In addition, we propose a stratified Bayesian adaptive randomization scheme such that more patients will be randomized to the dose reporting more favorable survival outcomes. Numerical studies and an illustrative trial example have shown that the proposed design performed well and outperformed the conventional design ignoring the competing risk issue.

More than 380,000 patients suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrest annually in the USA. Induced cooling of comatose patients markedly improved neurological and functional outcomes in pivotal randomized clinical trials, but the optimal duration of therapeutic hypothermia has not yet been established. Methods: This study is a multi-center randomized, response-adaptive, duration (dose) finding, comparative effectiveness clinical trial with blinded outcome assessment. We investigate two populations of adult comatose survivors of cardiac arrest to ascertain the shortest duration of cooling that provides the maximum treatment effect. The design is based on a statistical model of response as defined by the primary endpoint, a weighted 90-day mRS (modified Rankin Scale, a measure of neurologic disability), across the treatment arms. Subjects will initially be equally randomized between 12, 24, and 48 h of therapeutic cooling. After the first 200 subjects have been randomized, additional treatment arms between 12 and 48 h will be opened and patients will be allocated, within each initial cardiac rhythm type (shockable or non-shockable), by response adaptive randomization. As the trial continues, shorter and longer duration arms may be opened. A maximum sample size of 1800 subjects is proposed. Secondary objectives are to characterize: the overall safety and adverse events associated with duration of cooling, the effect on neuropsychological outcomes, and the effect on patient-reported quality of life measures. Discussion: In vitro and in vivo studies have shown the neuroprotective effects of therapeutic hypothermia for cardiac arrest. We hypothesize that longer durations of cooling may improve either the proportion of patients that attain a good neurological recovery or may result in better recovery among the proportion already categorized as having a good outcome. If the treatment effect of cooling is increasing across duration, for at least some set of durations, then this provides evidence of the efficacy of cooling itself versus normothermia, even in the absence of a normothermia control arm, confirming previous RCTs for OHCA survivors of shockable rhythms and provides the first prospective controlled evidence of efficacy in those without initial shockable rhythms.

CTD is a single-center prospective RAR comparative effectiveness trial to compare opt-in to opt-out tobacco treatment approaches for hospitalized patients. The design assumed an uninformative prior, conservative initial allocation ratio, and a higher threshold for stopping for success to protect results from statistical bias. A particular emerging concern of RAR designs is the possibility that time trends will occur during the implementation of a trial. If there is a time trend and the analytic plan does not prespecify an appropriate model, this could lead to a biased trial. Adjustment for time trend was not pre-specified in CTD, but post hoc time-adjusted analysis showed no presence of influential drift.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the 7th commonest solid cancer in the UK, exhibits targets for multiple new systemic anti-cancer agents including DNA damage response inhibitors, agents targeting vascular pathways and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Here we present the trial protocol for the WIndow-of-opportunity clinical trial platform for evaluation of novel treatment strategies in REnal cell cancer (WIRE). Methods: WIRE is a Phase II, multi-arm, multi-centre, non-randomised, proof-of-mechanism (single and combination investigational medicinal product [IMP]), platform trial using a Bayesian adaptive design. The Bayesian adaptive design leverages outcome information from initial participants during pre-specified interim analyses to determine and minimise the number of participants required to demonstrate efficacy or futility. Patients with biopsy-proven, surgically resectable, cT1b+, cN0-1, cM0-1 clear cell RCC and no contraindications to the IMPs are eligible to participate. Participants undergo diagnostic staging CT and renal mass biopsy followed by treatment in one of the treatment arms for at least 14 days. Initially, the trial includes five treatment arms with cediranib, cediranib + olaparib, olaparib, durvalumab and durvalumab + olaparib. Participants undergo a multiparametric MRI before and after treatment. Vascularised and de-vascularised tissue is collected at surgery. A ? 30% increase in CD8+ T-cells on immunohistochemistry between the screening and nephrectomy is the primary endpoint for durvalumab-containing arms. Meanwhile, a reduction in tumour vascular permeability measured by Ktrans on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI by ?30% is the primary endpoint for other arms. Secondary outcomes include adverse events and tumour size change. Exploratory outcomes include biomarkers of drug mechanism and treatment effects in blood, urine, tissue and imaging. Discussion: WIRE is the first trial using a window-of-opportunity design to demonstrate pharmacological activity of novel single and combination treatments in RCC in the pre-surgical space. It will provide rationale for prioritising promising treatments for later phase trials and support the development of new biomarkers of treatment effect with its extensive translational agenda.

However, psychological traits (PTs), considered internal variables, also play a crucial role in decision making. PTs are stable across time and contexts and define the set of behavioral repertoires that individuals express. Here, we explored how multiple metrics of adaptive behavior under uncertainty related to several PTs. Participants solved a reversal-learning task with volatile contingencies, from which we characterized a detailed behavioral profile based on their response sequences. We then tested the relationship between this multimetric behavioral profile and scores obtained from self-report psychological questionnaires. The PT measurements were based on the Hierarchical Taxonomy Of Psychopathology (HiTOP) model. By using multiple linear regression models (MLRMs), we found that the learning curves predicted important differences in the PTs and task response times. We confirmed the significance of these relationships by using random permutations of the predictors of the MLRM. Therefore, the behavioral profile configurations predicted the PTs and served as a ""fingerprint"" to identify participants with a high certainty level. We discuss briefly how this characterization and approach could contribute to better nosological classifications.

Although treatable, there is no known cure for this rare disorder, and its exact cause is unknown. Mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-2 (BMPR2) are the most common genetic cause of familial pulmonary arterial hypertension. This study represents the first-ever trial of treatments aimed at directly rescuing the BMPR2 pathway, repurposing two drugs that have shown promise at restoring levels of BMPR2 signalling: hydroxychloroquine and phenylbutyrate. Methods: This three-armed phase II precision medicine study will investigate BMPR2 target engagement and explore the efficacy of two repurposed therapies in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients with BMPR2 mutations. Patients will be stratified based on two BMPR2 mutation classes: missense and haploinsufficient mutations. Eligible subjects will be randomised to one of the three arms (two active therapy arms and a placebo arm, all plus standard of care) following a Bayesian response-adaptive design implemented independently in each stratum and updated in response to a novel panel of primary biomarkers designed to assess biological modification of the disease. Discussion: The results of this trial will provide the first randomised evidence of the efficacy of these therapies to rescue BMPR2 function and will efficiently explore the potential for a differential response of these therapies per mutation class to address causes rather than consequences of this rare disease.

In experiments an observer may ""lapse"" and respond with a random guess, which may negatively impact (e.g., bias) the psychometric fit parameters. A lapse-rate model has been popularized by Wichmann and Hill, which reduces the impact of lapses on other estimated parameters by adding a parameter to model the lapse rate. Since lapses are discrete events, we developed a discrete lapse theory and tested a ""lapse identification"" algorithm to identify individual outlier trials (i.e., potential lapses) based upon an approximate statistical criterion and discard these trials. Specifically, we focused on stimuli sampled using an adaptive staircase for a one-interval, direction-recognition task (i.e., psychometric function ranging from 0 to 1 and the spread of the curve corresponds to the threshold, which is often a parameter of interest for many fitted psychometric functions). Through simulations, we found that as the lapse rate increased the threshold became substantially overestimated, consistent with earlier analyses. While the lapse-rate model reduced the overestimation of threshold with many lapses, with lower lapse rates it yielded substantial threshold underestimation, though less so when fitting many (e.g., 1,000) trials. In comparison, the lapse-identification algorithm yielded accurate threshold estimates across a wide range of lapse rates (from 0 to 5%), which is critical since the lapse rate is seldom known. We further demonstrate the performance of the lapse-identification algorithm to be suitable for a variety of experimental conditions and conclude with some considerations of its use. In particular, we suggest using the lapse-identification algorithm unless the experiment has many trials (e.g., >500) or if somehow the lapse rate is known to be high (e.g., ?5%), for which the lapse-rate model approaches remain preferred.

Higher-than-necessary dosing is likely to cause excess bleeding. We designed an adaptive clinical trial to identify the minimum and assumed safest dose of tenecteplase that maintains efficacy. Methods: We propose a Bayesian adaptive, placebo-controlled, group-sequential dose-finding trial using response-adaptive randomization to preferentially allocate subjects to the most promising doses, dual analyses strategies (continuous and dichotomized) using a gatekeeping approach to maximize clinical impact, and interim stopping rules to efficiently address competing trial objectives. The operating characteristics of the proposed design were evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation across multiple hypothetical efficacy scenarios. Results: Simulation demonstrated response-adaptive randomization can preferentially allocate subjects to doses which appear to be performing well based on interim data. Interim decision-making, including the interim evaluation of both analysis strategies with gatekeeping, allows the trial to continue enrollment when success with the dichotomized analysis strategy appears sufficiently likely and to stop enrollment and declare superiority based on the continuous analysis strategy when there is little chance of ultimately declaring superiority with the dichotomized analysis. Conclusion: The proposed design allows evaluation of a greater number of dose levels than would be possible with a non-adaptive design and avoids the need to choose either the continuous or the dichotomized analysis strategy for the primary endpoint.

We discuss recent developments in critical care RCTs and novel methods that may provide solutions to some of these challenges, including a research programme approach (consecutive, complementary studies of multiple types rather than individual, independent studies), and novel design and analysis methods. These include standardization of trial protocols; alternative outcome choices and use of core outcome sets; increased acceptance of uncertainty, probabilistic interpretations and use of Bayesian statistics; novel approaches to assessing heterogeneity of treatment effects; adaptation and platform trials; and increased integration between clinical trials and clinical practice.

The treatment randomization process is formatted as a Markov decision process and the Bayesian method is used to summarize the information on treatment effects. A span-contraction operator is introduced and the average reward generated by the policy identified by the operator is shown to converge to the optimal value. We propose an algorithm to approximate the optimal treatment allocation using the Thompson sampling and the contraction operator. For the scenario of two treatments with binary responses and a sample size of 200 patients, simulation results demonstrate efficient learning features of the proposed method. It allocates a high proportion of patients to the better treatment while retaining a good statistical power and having a small probability for a trial going in the undesired direction. When the difference in success probability to detect is 0.2, the probability for a trial going in the unfavorable direction is < 1.5%, which decreases further to < 0.9% when the difference to detect is 0.3. For normally distribution responses, with a sample size of 100 patients, the proposed method assigns 13% more patients to the better treatment than the traditional complete randomization in detecting an effect size of difference 0.8, with a good statistical power and a < 0.7% probability for the trial to go in the undesired direction.

Two randomized trials indicated an ePTB reduction among pregnant women receiving high-dose docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation. One of them is Assessment of DHA on Reducing Early Preterm Birth (ADORE). A survey employed in its secondary analysis identified women with low DHA levels, revealing that they derived greater benefits from high-dose DHA supplementation. This survey's inclusion in future trials can provide critical insights for informing clinical practices. Objective: To optimize a Phase III trial design, ADORE Precision, aiming at assessing DHA supplement (200 vs. 1000 mg/day) on reducing ePTB among pregnant women with a low baseline DHA. Methods: We propose a Bayesian Hybrid Response Adaptive Randomization (RAR) Design utilizing a finite mixture model to characterize gestational age at birth. Subsequently, a dichotomized ePTB outcome is used to inform trial design using RAR. Simulation studies were conducted to compare a Fixed Design, an Adaptive Design with early stopping, an ADORE-like Adaptive RAR Design, and two new Hybrid Designs with different hyperpriors. Discussion: Simulation reveals several advantages of the RAR designs, such as higher allocation to the more promising dose and a trial duration reduction. The proposed Hybrid RAR Designs addresses the statistical power drop observed in Adaptive RAR. The new design model shows robustness to hyperprior choices.

As a result, sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) have gained attention as the most suitable clinical trial design to formalize the study of these strategies. While the number of SMARTs has increased in recent years, sample size and design considerations have generally been carried out in frequentist settings. However, standard frequentist formulae require assumptions on interim response rates and variance components. Misspecifying these can lead to incorrect sample size calculations and correspondingly inadequate levels of power. The Bayesian framework offers a straightforward path to alleviate some of these concerns. In this paper, we provide calculations in a Bayesian setting to allow more realistic and robust estimates that account for uncertainty in inputs through the 'two priors' approach. Additionally, compared to the standard frequentist formulae, this methodology allows us to rely on fewer assumptions, integrate pre-trial knowledge, and switch the focus from the standardized effect size to the MDD. The proposed methodology is evaluated in a thorough simulation study and is implemented to estimate the sample size for a full-scale SMART of an internet-based adaptive stress management intervention on cardiovascular disease patients using data from its pilot study conducted in two Canadian provinces.

In addition, in recent years there has been a trend toward phase I/II trials in which a phase I and a phase II trial are combined into a single trial to accelerate drug development. Methods for the seamless combination of phases I and II parts are currently under investigation. In the phase II part, adaptive randomization on the basis of patient efficacy outcomes allocates more patients to the dose combinations considered to have higher efficacy. Patient toxicity outcomes are used for determining admissibility to each dose combination and are not used for selection of the dose combination itself. In cases where the objective is not to find the optimum dose combination solely for efficacy but regarding both toxicity and efficacy, the need exists to allocate patients to dose combinations with consideration of the balance of existing trade-offs between toxicity and efficacy. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model and an adaptive randomization with consideration for the relationship with toxicity and efficacy. Using the toxicity and efficacy outcomes of patients, the Bayesian hierarchical model is used to estimate the toxicity probability and efficacy probability in each of the dose combinations. Here, we use Bayesian moving-reference adaptive randomization on the basis of desirability computed from the obtained estimator. Computer simulations suggest that the proposed method will likely recommend a higher percentage of target dose combinations than a previously proposed method.

Owing to the long periods of observation and follow-up to assess patient survival outcome, it is difficult to use outcome-adaptive randomization in these trials. In practice, often information about a short-term response is quickly available during or shortly after treatment, and this short-term response is a good predictor for long-term survival. For example, complete remission of leukemia can be achieved and measured after a few cycles of treatment. It is a short-term response that is desirable for prolonging survival. We propose a new design for survival trials when such short-term response information is available. We use the short-term information to 'speed up' the adaptation of the randomization procedure. We establish a connection between the short-term response and the long-term survival through a Bayesian model, first by using prior clinical information, and then by dynamically updating the model according to information accumulated in the ongoing trial. Interim monitoring and final decision making are based upon inference on the primary outcome of survival. The new design uses fewer patients, and can more effectively assign patients to the better treatment arms. We demonstrate these properties through simulation studies.",,Y,,,

We construct a latent subgroup membership variable and model it as a function of the baseline and pre-post radiotherapy change in the predictive biomarker measurements. Conditional on the latent subgroup membership of each patient, we jointly model the continuous immune response and the binary efficacy outcome using plateau models, and model toxicity using the equivalent toxicity score approach to account for toxicity grades. During the trial, based on accumulating data, we continuously update model estimates and adaptively randomize patients to admissible doses.

In this prospective Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center Breast Cancer Precision Platform Series study - neoadjuvant therapy (FASCINATE-N) trial, we classify breast cancer patients using multiomic characteristics into different subtypes to evaluate the efficacy of precision-based targeted therapies compared to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Methods and design: The FASCINATE-N trial is a prospective, randomized, precision-based umbrella trial that plans to enroll 716 women with early breast cancer. After enrollment, patients will first be divided into three groups: hormone receptor (HR)+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-, HER2+, and HR-/HER2-. The HR+/HER2- patients are further stratified using fusion and clustering of similarity network fusion (SNF) algorithm into four subtypes; HER2+ patients are divided into HR+/HER2+ and HR-/HER2+ subtypes; and HR-/HER2- patients are stratified using the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center classification. For the assignment of drugs to patients, Bayesian methods of adaptive randomization will be used. The primary endpoint is pathological complete response rate; secondary endpoints include 3-year invasive disease-free survival, overall response rate, and toxicities according to common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) scale version 4.0 and the ratio of patients with complete cell cycle arrest (Ki67 < 2.7%) in HR+/HER2+ breast cancer. Discussion: The goal of our trial is to test the efficacy of our subtyping-based treatment in a neoadjuvant setting and to conduct a pilot study into the efficacy of targeted therapies within each precision-based subtype. The precision-based treatment arm can be updated with the refinement of our subtyping method, the discovery of new targets, and the development of novel targeted drugs. Our trial offers a unique opportunity to provide patients with individualized neoadjuvant therapy and test promising novel treatments that may further benefit patients.

This can be complicated in cases when the phase II trial objective is to identify a novel treatment having several factors. Such multifactor treatment scenarios can be explored using fixed sample size trials. However, the alternative design could be response adaptive randomization with interim analyses and additionally, longitudinal modeling whereby more data could be used in the estimation process. This combined approach allows a quicker and more responsive adaptation to early estimates of later endpoints. Such alternative clinical trial designs are potentially more powerful, faster, and smaller than fixed randomized designs. Such designs are particularly challenging, however, because phase II trials tend to be smaller than subsequent confirmatory phase III trials. The phase II trial may need to explore a large number of treatment variations to ensure that the efficacy of optimal clinical conditions is not overlooked. Adaptive trial designs need to be carefully evaluated to understand how they will perform and to take full advantage of their potential benefits. This manuscript discusses a Bayesian response adaptive randomization design with a longitudinal model that uses a multifactor approach for predicting phase III study success via the phase II data.

To address relevant patient management issues, we designed a ""Randomized Embedded Multifactorial Adaptive Platform (REMAP)"" in the setting of ECMO (REMAP ECMO) and a first embedded randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the effects of routine early left ventricular (LV) unloading through intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP). Methods: REMAP ECMO describes a registry-based platform allowing for the embedding of multiple response adaptive RCTs (trial domains) which can perpetually address the effect of relevant patient management issues on ECMO weaning success. A first trial domain studies the effects of LV unloading by means of an IABP as an adjunct to veno-arterial (V-A) ECMO versus V-A ECMO alone on ECMO weaning success at 30 days in adult cardiogenic shock patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The primary outcome of this trial is ""successful weaning from ECMO"" being defined as a composite of survival without the need for mechanical circulatory support, heart transplantation, or left ventricular assist device (LVAD) at 30 days after initiation of ECMO. Secondary outcomes include the need for interventional escalation of LV unloading strategy, mechanistic endpoints, survival characteristics until 1 year after ECMO initiation, and quality of life. Trial data will be analysed using a Bayesian statistical framework. The adaptive design allows for a high degree of flexibility, such as response adaptive randomization and early stopping of the trial for efficacy or futility. The REMAP ECMO LV unloading study is approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the Erasmus Medical Center and is publicly registered. Conclusion: This REMAP ECMO trial platform enables the efficient roll-out of multiple RCTs on relevant patient management issues.

PBI-05204 was generally well tolerated, with the most common side effects related to treatment being vomiting (23.7%), nausea (18.4%), decreased appetite (18.4%), and diarrhea (15.8%). Additional trials are needed to explore the role of PBI-05204 in cancer treatment. Background: Survival for metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDA) is dismal, and novel agents are needed. PBI-05204 is a modified supercritical carbon dioxide extract of Nerium oleander leaves. Oleandrin, the extract's major cytotoxic component, is a cardiac glycoside that has demonstrated antitumor activity in various tumor cell lines with a mechanism involving inhibition of Akt phosphorylation and through downregulation of mTOR. Methods: A phase II, single-arm, open-label study to determine the efficacy of PBI-05204 in patients with refractory mPDA therapy was conducted. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), with the hypothesis that 50% of patients would be alive at 4.5 months. Secondary objectives included safety, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall response rate. Patients received oral PBI-05204 daily until progressive disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal. Radiographic response was assessed every two cycles. Results: Forty-two patients were enrolled, and 38 were analyzed. Ten patients were alive at 4.5 months (26.3%) with a median PFS of 56 days. One objective response (2.6%) was observed for 162 days. Grade ? 3 treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 63.2% of patients with the most common being fatigue, vomiting, nausea, decreased appetite, and diarrhea. Conclusion: PBI-05204 did not meet its primary endpoint for OS in this study. Recent preclinical data indicate a role for PBI-05204 against glioblastoma multiforme when combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. A randomized phase II trial is currently being designed.

Biomarkers are a critical component of a targeted therapy as they can be used to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from a treatment. Targeted therapies, however, have created major challenges in the design, conduct, and analysis of clinical trials. In traditional clinical trials, treatment effects for various biomarkers are typically evaluated in an exploratory fashion and only limited information about the predictive values of biomarkers obtained. Purpose: New study designs are required, which effectively evaluate both the diagnostic and the therapeutic implication of biomarkers. Methods: The Bayesian approach provides a useful framework for optimizing the clinical trial design by directly integrating information about biomarkers and clinical outcomes as they become available. We propose a Bayesian covariate-adjusted response-adaptive randomization design, which utilizes individual biomarker profiles and patient's clinical outcomes as they become available during the course of the trial, to assign the most efficacious treatment to individual patients. Predictive biomarker subgroups are determined adaptively using a partial least squares regression approach. Results: A series of simulation studies were conducted to examine the operating characteristics of the proposed study design. The simulation studies show that the proposed design efficiently identifies patients who benefit most from a targeted therapy and that there are substantial savings in the sample size requirements when compared to alternative designs. Limitations: The design does not control for the type I error in the traditional sense and a positive result should be confirmed by conducting an independent phase III study focusing on the selected biomarker profile groups. Conclusions: We conclude that the proposed design may serve a useful role in the early efficacy phase of targeted therapy development.",,Y,,,

Critical knowledge gaps regarding COVID-19 vaccination include the duration of protection offered by different priming and booster vaccination regimens in different populations, including homologous or heterologous schedules; how vaccination impacts key elements of the immune system; how this is modified by prior or subsequent exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and future variants; and how immune responses correlate with protection against infection and disease, including antibodies and effector and T cell central memory. Methods: The Platform Trial In COVID-19 priming and BOOsting (PICOBOO) is a multi-site, multi-arm, Bayesian, adaptive, randomised controlled platform trial. PICOBOO will expeditiously generate and translate high-quality evidence of the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and cross-protection of different COVID-19 priming and booster vaccination strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants/subvariants, specific to the Australian context. While the platform is designed to be vaccine agnostic, participants will be randomised to one of three vaccines at trial commencement, including Pfizer's Comirnaty, Moderna's Spikevax or Novavax's Nuvaxovid COVID-19 vaccine. The protocol structure specifying PICOBOO is modular and hierarchical. Here, we describe the Core Protocol, which outlines the trial processes applicable to all study participants included in the platform trial. Discussion: PICOBOO is the first adaptive platform trial evaluating different COVID-19 priming and booster vaccination strategies in Australia, and one of the few established internationally, that is designed to generate high-quality evidence to inform immunisation practice and policy. The modular, hierarchical protocol structure is intended to standardise outcomes, endpoints, data collection and other study processes for nested substudies included in the trial platform and to minimise duplication. It is anticipated that this flexible trial structure will enable investigators to respond with agility to new research questions as they arise, such as the utility of new vaccines (such as bivalent, or SARS-CoV-2 variant-specific vaccines) as they become available for use.

Design: The Pediatric Influence of Cooling duration on Efficacy in Cardiac Arrest Patients (P-ICECAP) trial is a randomized, response-adaptive duration/dose-finding clinical trial with blinded outcome assessment. Participants are randomized to one of several cooling durations (0, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, or 96 hr). The first 150 participants are randomized 1:1:1 to 24-, 48-, and 72-hour durations. Response-adaptive randomization is used thereafter to allocate participants based on emerging duration-response data. Setting: PICUs. Patients: Up to 900 pediatric patients 2 days to younger than 18 years old who have survived OHCA and been admitted to an ICU. Interventions: Duration of targeted temperature management using a surface temperature control device. Measurements and main results: The primary outcome is the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Third Edition mortality composite score, assessed at 12 months. Secondary outcomes include changes in the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category and Pediatric Resuscitation after Cardiac Arrest scores, as well as survival at 12 months. Bayesian modeling is employed to evaluate the duration-response curve and determine the optimal cooling duration. The trial is designed to adaptively update randomization probabilities every 10 weeks, maximizing the allocation of participants to potentially optimal cooling durations. Over 90% power is achieved for the hypothesized scenarios. Conclusions: The P-ICECAP trial aims to identify the shortest cooling duration that provides the maximum treatment effect for pediatric OHCA patients. The adaptive design allows for flexibility and efficiency in handling various clinical scenarios, potentially transforming pediatric cardiac arrest care by optimizing hypothermia treatment protocols.",,Y,,,

Pharmacokinetic (PK) information is considered an appropriate indicator for evaluating the level of drug intervention in humans from a pharmacological perspective. Several novel anticancer agents have been shown to have significant exposure-efficacy relationships, and some PK information has been considered an important predictor of efficacy. This paper proposes a Bayesian optimal interval design for dose optimization with a randomization scheme based on PK outcomes in oncology. A simulation study shows that the proposed design has advantages compared to the other designs in the percentage of correct OD selection and the average number of patients allocated to OD in various realistic settings.

However, traditional meta-learning methods have limitations as they provide an optimal initialization for all new tasks, disregarding the inherent uncertainty induced by few-shot tasks and impeding task-specific self-adaptation initialization. In response to this challenge, this article proposes a novel probabilistic meta-learning approach called prototype Bayesian meta-learning (PBML). PBML focuses on meta-learning variational posteriors within a Bayesian framework, guided by prototype-conditioned prior information. Specifically, to capture model uncertainty, PBML treats both meta-and task-specific parameters as random variables and integrates their posterior estimates into hierarchical Bayesian modeling through variational inference (VI). During model inference, PBML employs Laplacian estimation to approximate the integral term over the likelihood loss, deriving a rigorous upper-bound for generalization errors. To enhance the model's expressiveness and enable task-specific adaptive initialization, PBML proposes a data-driven approach to model the task-specific variational posteriors. This is achieved by designing a generative model structure that incorporates prototype-conditioned task-dependent priors into the random generation of task-specific variational posteriors. Additionally, by performing latent embedding optimization, PBML decouples the gradient-based meta-learning from the high-dimensional variational parameter space. Experimental results on benchmark datasets for few-shot image classification illustrate that PBML attains state-of-the-art or competitive performance when compared to other related works. Versatility studies demonstrate the adaptability and applicability of PBML in addressing diverse and challenging few-shot tasks. Furthermore, ablation studies validate the performance gains attributed to the inference and model components.",,Y,,,

Due to its unique features and mechanisms for treating cancer, immunotherapy requires novel clinical trial designs. We propose a Bayesian seamless phase I/II randomized design for immunotherapy trials (SPIRIT) to find the optimal biological dose (OBD) defined in terms of the restricted mean survival time. We jointly model progression-free survival and the immune response. Progression-free survival is used as the primary endpoint to determine the OBD, and the immune response is used as an ancillary endpoint to quickly screen out futile doses. Toxicity is monitored throughout the trial. The design consists of two seamlessly connected stages. The first stage identifies a set of safe doses. The second stage adaptively randomizes patients to the safe doses identified and uses their progression-free survival and immune response to find the OBD. The simulation study shows that the SPIRIT has desirable operating characteristics and outperforms the conventional design.

In HMB endometrium, inactivation of cortisol (by enzyme 11? hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11?HSD2)), may cause local endometrial glucocorticoid deficiency and hence increased angiogenesis and impaired vasoconstriction. We propose that 'rescue' of luteal phase endometrial glucocorticoid deficiency could reduce menstrual bleeding. Methods and analysis: DexFEM is a double-blind response-adaptive parallel-group placebo-controlled trial in women with HMB (108 to be randomised), with active treatment the potent oral synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, which is relatively resistant to 11?HSD2 inactivation. Participants will be aged over 18 years, with mean measured menstrual blood loss (MBL) for two screening cycles ?50 mL. The primary outcome is reduction in MBL from screening. Secondary end points are questionnaire assessments of treatment effect and acceptability. Treatment will be for 5 days in the mid-luteal phases of three treatment menstrual cycles. Six doses of low-dose dexamethasone (ranging from 0.2 to 0.9 mg twice daily) will be compared with placebo, to ascertain optimal dose, and whether this has advantage over placebo. Statistical efficiency is maximised by allowing randomisation probabilities to 'adapt' at five points during enrolment phase, based on the response data available so far, to favour doses expected to provide greatest additional information on the dose-response. Bayesian Normal Dynamic Linear Modelling, with baseline MBL included as covariate, will determine optimal dose (re reduction in MBL). Secondary end points will be analysed using generalised dynamic linear models. For each dose for all end points, a 95% credible interval will be calculated for effect versus placebo.

When conducting an in-depth analysis of microinfection dynamics, one must account for the substantial heterogeneity across countries. However, many commonly used statistical model specifications lack the flexibility needed for sound and accurate analysis and prediction in such contexts. Nonlinear mixed effects models (NLMMs) constitute a specific statistical tool that can overcome these significant challenges. While compartmental models are well-established in infectious disease modeling and have seen significant advancements, Nonlinear Mixed Models (NLMMs) offer a flexible approach for handling heterogeneous and unbalanced repeated measures data, often with less computational effort than some individual-level compartmental modeling techniques. This study provides an overview of their current use and offers a solid foundation for developing guidelines that may help improve their implementation in real-world situations. Relevant scientific databases in the Research4life Access initiative programs were used to search for papers dealing with key aspects of NLMMs in infectious disease modeling (IDM). From an initial list of 3641 papers, 124 were finally included and used for this systematic and critical review spanning the last two decades, following the PRISMA guidelines. NLMMs have evolved rapidly in the last decade, especially in IDM, with most publications dating from 2017 to 2021 (83.33%). The routine use of normality assumption appeared inappropriate for IDM, leading to a wealth of literature on NLMMs with non-normal errors and random effects under various estimation methods. We noticed that NLMMs have attracted much attention for the latest known epidemics worldwide (COVID-19, Ebola, Dengue and Lassa) with the robustness and reliability of relaxed propositions of the normality assumption. A case study of the application of COVID-19 data helped to highlight NLMMs' performance in modeling infectious diseases. Out of this study, estimation methods, assumptions, and random terms specification in NLMMs are key aspects requiring particular attention for their application in IDM.

Objective: To determine the efficacy of weekly paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab as treatment for relapsed sex cord-stromal tumors and evaluate whether the addition of bevacizumab to weekly paclitaxel improves 6-month progression-free rate. Design, setting, and participants: This open-label, academic, international, randomized phase 2 trial (ALIENOR) was conducted at 28 referral centers in France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Belgium in collaboration with the Rare Tumor committee of the Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup and used an adaptive bayesian design. It included 60 women with sex cord-stromal tumors that had relapsed after at least 1 platinum-based chemotherapy. Enrollment occurred from 2013 to 2016, and the final analysis database lock was on March 27, 2020 (median follow-up, 38.9 months). Interventions: Participants were randomized to receive either paclitaxel (80 mg/m2, days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks) alone or paclitaxel with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg, every 2 weeks) for 6 cycles followed by maintenance bevacizumab (15 mg/kg, every 3 weeks) for up to 1 year or until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Crossover to bevacizumab was permitted after progression during or following paclitaxel alone. Main outcomes and measures: Six-month progression-free rate. Results: Sixty patients (predominantly with granulosa cell tumors) were randomized, 32 to receive single-agent paclitaxel (median [interquartile range] age at inclusion, 60 [53-64] years) and 28 to receive paclitaxel-bevacizumab (median [interquartile range] age at inclusion, 55 [47-61] years; 1 did not receive treatment). The estimated 6-month progression-free rate was 71% (95% credible interval, 55%-84%) with paclitaxel alone and 72% (95% credible interval, 55%-87%) with paclitaxel-bevacizumab. The bayesian estimate for the probability that the 6-month progression-free rate distribution was higher with the combination than with paclitaxel alone was 57%, less than the predefined superiority threshold. The objective response rate increased from 25% (95% CI, 12%-43%) to 44% (95% CI, 26%-65%) with the addition of bevacizumab. One patient discontinued combination therapy within 6 months because of toxicity. Conclusions and relevance: Weekly paclitaxel is a new option for relapsed sex cord-stromal tumors. In this international randomized clinical trial of patients with relapsed sex cord-stromal tumors unsuitable for surgery, adding bevacizumab to weekly paclitaxel does not improve clinical benefit.

These designs rely on the implicit assumption that the dose of an experimental agent chosen using these short-term outcomes will maximize the agent's long-term therapeutic success rate. In many clinical settings, this assumption is not true. A dose selected in an early phase oncology trial may give suboptimal progression-free survival or overall survival time, often due to a high rate of relapse following response. To address this problem, a new family of Bayesian generalized phase I-II designs is proposed. First, a conventional phase I-II design based on short-term outcomes is used to identify a set of candidate doses, rather than selecting one dose. Additional patients then are randomized among the candidates, patients are followed for a predefined longer time period, and a final dose is selected to maximize the long-term therapeutic success rate, defined in terms of duration of response. Dose-specific sample sizes in the randomization are determined adaptively to obtain a desired level of selection reliability. The design was motivated by a phase I-II trial to find an optimal dose of natural killer cells as targeted immunotherapy for recurrent or treatment-resistant B-cell hematologic malignancies.

Recently, as a compromise, the single-to-double arm transition design was proposed, combining the two designs into one trial over two stages. Successful implementation of the two-stage transition design requires a suspension period at the end of the first stage to collect the response data of the already enrolled patients. When the evaluation of the primary efficacy endpoint is overly long, the between-stage suspension period may unfavorably prolong the trial duration and cause a delay in treating future eligible patients. To accelerate the trial, we propose a Bayesian single-to-double arm design with short-term endpoints (BSDS), where an intermediate short-term endpoint is used for making early termination decisions at the end of the single-arm stage, followed by an evaluation of the long-term endpoint at the end of the subsequent double-arm stage. Bayesian posterior probabilities are used as the primary decision-making tool at the end of the trial. Design calibration steps are proposed for this Bayesian monitoring process to control the frequentist operating characteristics and minimize the expected sample size. Extensive simulation studies have demonstrated that our design has comparable power and average sample size but a much shorter trial duration than conventional single-to-double arm design. Applications of the design are illustrated using two phase II oncology trials with binary endpoints.

The objective function used in the shadow-test model selects both the operational and field-test items adaptively using a Bayesian version of the criterion of [Formula: see text]-optimality. The constraint set for the model can be used to hide the field-test items completely in the content of the test as well as to deal with such practical issues as random control of their exposure rates. The approach runs on efficient implementations of the Gibbs sampler for the real-time updating of the ability and field-test parameters. Optimal settings for the proposed algorithms were found and used to demonstrate item calibration with smaller than traditional sample sizes in runtimes fully comparable with conventional adaptive testing.

Methods: Adults and elderly subjects with insomnia disorder per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Bayesian, adaptive, parallel-group study, receiving lemborexant (1, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 25 mg) or placebo for 15 nights. Efficacy assessments included a utility function that combined efficacy (SE) and safety (residual morning sleepiness as measured by Karolinska Sleepiness Scale [KSS]), PSG measures, and sleep diary. Safety assessments included KSS, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, computerized reaction time tests, and adverse events (AEs). Results: A total of 616 subjects were screened; 291 were randomized. Baseline characteristics were similar between lemborexant groups and placebo (?63% female, median age: 49.0 years). The study was stopped for early success after the fifth interim analysis when the 15-mg dose met utility index/KSS criteria for success; 3 other doses also met the criteria.

I-SPY2 is a multicenter, phase II adaptively randomized neoadjuvant (NAC) clinical trial enrolling patients with stage II-III breast cancer with tumors 2.5 cm or larger on the basis of hormone receptors (HR), HER2 and Mammaprint status. Multiple novel investigational agents plus standard chemotherapy are evaluated in parallel for the primary endpoint of pathologic complete response (pCR). Patients with HER2-negative breast cancer were eligible for randomization to ganetespib from October 2014 to October 2015. Of 233 women included in the final analysis, 140 were randomized to the standard NAC control; 93 were randomized to receive 150 mg/m2 ganetespib every 3 weeks with weekly paclitaxel over 12 weeks, followed by AC. Arms were balanced for hormone receptor status (51-52% HR-positive). Ganetespib did not graduate in any of the biomarker signatures studied before reaching maximum enrollment. Final estimated pCR rates were 26% vs. 18% HER2-negative, 38% vs. 22% HR-negative/HER2-negative, and 15% vs. 14% HR-positive/HER2-negative for ganetespib vs control, respectively. The predicted probability of success in phase 3 testing was 47% HER2-negative, 72% HR-negative/HER2-negative, and 19% HR-positive/HER2-negative. Ganetespib added to standard therapy is unlikely to yield substantially higher pCR rates in HER2-negative breast cancer compared to standard NAC, and neither HSP90 pathway nor replicative stress expression markers predicted response.

Trial design: Open-label, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness platform trial with response-adaptive randomization PARTICIPANTS: We will evaluate patients who meet the eligibility criteria stipulated by the COVID-19 mAB EUAs who receive mABs within the UPMC Health System, including infusion centers and emergency departments. EUA eligibility criteria include patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, <10 days of symptoms, and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization (elderly, obese, and/or with specific comorbidities). The EUA criteria exclude patients who require oxygen for the treatment of COVID-19 and patients already hospitalized for the treatment of COVID-19. We will use data collected for routine clinical care, including data entered into the electronic medical record and from follow-up calls. Intervention and comparator: The interventions are the COVID-19 specific mABs authorized by the EUAs. All aspects of mAB treatment, including eligibility criteria, dosing, and post-infusion monitoring, are as per the EUAs. As a comparative effectiveness trial, all patients receive mAB treatment, and the interventions are compared against each other. When U.S. government mAB policies change (e.g., FDA grants or revokes EUAs), UPMC Health System policies and the evaluated mAB interventions will accordingly change. From November 2020 to February 2021, FDA issued EUAs for three mAB treatments (bamlanivimab; bamlanivimab and etesevimab; and casirivimab and imdevimab), and at trial launch on March 10, 2021 we evaluated all three. Due to a sustained increase in SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United States resistant to bamlanivimab administered alone, on March 24, 2021 the U.S. Government halted distribution of bamlanivimab alone, and UPMC accordingly halted bamlanivimab monotherapy on March 31, 2021. On April 16, 2021, FDA revoked the EUA for bamlanivimab monotherapy. At the time of manuscript submission, we are therefore evaluating the two mAB treatments authorized by EUAs (bamlanivimab and etesevimab; and casirivimab and imdevimab). Main outcomes: The primary outcome is total hospital free days (HFD) at 28 days after mAB administration, calculated as 28 minus the number of days during the index stay (if applicable - e.g., for patients admitted to hospital after mAB administration in the emergency department) minus the number of days readmitted during the 28 days after treatment. This composite endpoint captures the number of days from the day of mAB administration to the 28 days thereafter, during which the patient is alive and free of hospitalization. Death within 28 days is recorded as -1 HFD, as the worst outcome. Randomisation: We will start with equal allocation. Due to uncertainty in sample size, we will use a Bayesian adaptive design and response adaptive randomization to ensure ability to provide statistical inference despite variable sample size. When mABs are ordered by UPMC physicians as a generic referral order, the order is filled by UPMC pharmacy via therapeutic interchange. OPTIMISE-C19 provides the therapeutic interchange via random allocation. Infusion center operations teams and pharmacists use a mAB assignment application embedded in the electronic medical record to determine the random allocation. Blinding (masking): This trial is open-label. However, outcome assessors conducting follow-up calls at day 28 are blinded to mAB assignment, and investigators are blinded to by-mAB aggregate outcome data until a statistical platform trial conclusion is reached. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): Sample size will be determined by case volume throughout the course of the pandemic, supply of FDA authorized mABs, and by that needed to reach a platform trial conclusion of inferiority, superiority, or futility of a given mAB. The trial will continue as long as more than one mAB type is available under EUA, and their comparative effectiveness is uncertain. Trial status: Protocol Version 1.0, February 24, 2021. Recruitment began March 10, 2021 and is ongoing at the time of manuscript submission. The estimated recruitment end date is February 22, 2022, though the final end date is dependent on how the pandemic evolves, mAB availability, and when final platform trial conclusions are reached. As noted above, due to U.S. Government decisions, UPMC Health System halted bamlanivimab monotherapy on March 31, 2021. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04790786 .

In this paper, we investigate these claims in the setting of continuous dose levels of the two agents. Parametric models will be used to describe the relationship between the doses of the two agents and the probability of dose limiting toxicity and efficacy. Trial design proceeds by treating cohorts of two patients simultaneously receiving different dose combinations and response adaptive randomization. We compare trial safety and efficiency of the estimated maximum tolerated dose (MTD) curve between models that include an interaction term with models without the synergism parameter with extensive simulations. Under a selected class of dose-toxicity models and dose escalation algorithm, we found that not including an interaction term in the model can compromise the safety of the trial and reduce the pointwise reliability of the estimated MTD curve.

Methods: This was a single-centre, randomized, double-blind, adaptive study of 37 subjects receiving single ascending oral doses of RG7342 (ranging from 0.06-1.2 mg, n = 27) or placebo (n = 10). A modified continual reassessment method, with control for the probability of overdosing based on the occurrence of dose-limiting events (DLEs), was applied to inform the subsequent dose decisions for RG7342. Results: DLEs consisted of dizziness, nausea and vomiting, and the incidence and severity of these adverse events increased in a concentration-dependent manner. RG7342 doses of 1.2 mg under fasting conditions, which reached a mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax ) of 10.2 ng ml-1 , were not tolerated (four out of six subjects experienced DLEs). RG7342 showed dose-proportional pharmacokinetics, with rapid absorption and a biphasic decline, and a mean terminal half-life estimated to be >1000 h. Conclusions: Single oral doses of RG7342 were generally tolerated up to 0.6 mg under fasting and 0.9 mg under fed conditions in healthy subjects. Bayesian adaptive methods describing the probability of DLEs were applied effectively to support dose escalation. MTDs (fasting, fed) were associated with a Cmax of 6.5 ng ml-1 . The development of RG7342 was discontinued owing to the potential challenges associated with a long half-life in context of the observed adverse events.

Chronic stress may gravely affect the physical, mental, and social behavior of victims and consequently induce myriad critical human disorders. Herein, a review has been presented where supervised learning (SL) and soft computing (SC) techniques used in stress diagnosis have been meticulously investigated to highlight the contributions, strengths, and challenges faced in the implementation of these methods in stress diagnostic models. A three-tier review strategy comprising of manuscript selection, data synthesis, and data analysis was adopted. The issues in SL strategies and the potential possibility of using hybrid techniques in stress diagnosis have been intensively investigated. The strengths and weaknesses of different SL (Bayesian classifier, random forest, support vector machine, and nearest neighbours) and SC (fuzzy logic, nature-inspired, and deep learning) techniques have been presented to obtain clear insights into these optimization strategies. The effects of social, behavioral, and biological stresses have been highlighted. The psychological, biological, and behavioral responses to stress have also been briefly elucidated. The findings of the study confirmed that different types of data/signals (related to skin temperature, electro-dermal activity, blood circulation, heart rate, facial expressions, etc.) have been used in stress diagnosis. Moreover, there is a potential scope for using distinct nature-inspired computing techniques (Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Ant Colony Optimization, Whale Optimization Algorithm, Butterfly Optimization, Harris Hawks Optimizer, and Crow Search Algorithm) and deep learning techniques (Deep-Belief Network, Convolutional-Neural Network, and Recurrent-Neural Network) on multimodal data compiled using behavioral testing, electroencephalogram signals, finger temperature, respiration rate, pupil diameter, galvanic-skin-response, and blood pressure. Likewise, there is a wider scope to investigate the use of SL and SC techniques in stress diagnosis using distinct dimensions such as sentiment analysis, speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and facial expressions. Finally, a hybrid model based on distinct computational methods influenced by both SL and SC techniques, adaption, parameter tuning, and the use of chaos, levy, and Gaussian distribution may address exploration and exploitation issues. However, factors such as real-time data collection, bias, integrity, multi-dimensional data, and data privacy make it challenging to design precise and innovative stress diagnostic systems based on artificial intelligence.

In this article, we will document what has happened since that time. In addition, we will describe barriers to implementing Bayesian clinical trials, as well as our experience overcoming them. Methods: We reviewed MD Anderson Cancer Center clinical trials submitted to the institutional protocol office for scientific and ethical review between January 2009 and December 2013, the same length time period as the previous article. We tabulated Bayesian methods implemented for design or analyses for each trial and then compared these to our previous findings. Results: Overall, we identified 1020 trials and found that 283 (28%) had Bayesian components so we designated them as Bayesian trials. Among MD Anderson-only and multicenter trials, 56% and 14%, respectively, were Bayesian, higher rates than our previous study. Bayesian trials were more common in phase I/II trials (34%) than in phase III/IV (6%) trials. Among Bayesian trials, the most commonly used features were for toxicity monitoring (65%), efficacy monitoring (36%), and dose finding (22%). The majority (86%) of Bayesian trials used non-informative priors. A total of 75 (27%) trials applied Bayesian methods for trial design and primary endpoint analysis. Among this latter group, the most commonly used methods were the Bayesian logistic regression model (N = 22), the continual reassessment method (N = 20), and adaptive randomization (N = 16). Median institutional review board approval time from protocol submission was the same 1.4 months for Bayesian and non-Bayesian trials. Since the previous publication, the Biomarker-Integrated Approaches of Targeted Therapy for Lung Cancer Elimination (BATTLE) trial was the first large-scale decision trial combining multiple treatments in a single trial. Since then, two regimens in breast cancer therapy have been identified and published from the cooperative Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with Imaging and Molecular Analysis (I-SPY 2), enhancing cooperation among investigators and drug developers across the nation, as well as advancing information needed for personalized medicine. Many software programs and Shiny applications for Bayesian trial design and calculations are available from our website which has had more than 21,000 downloads worldwide since 2004. Conclusion: Bayesian trials have the increased flexibility in trial design needed for personalized medicine, resulting in more cooperation among researchers working to fight against cancer. Some disadvantages of Bayesian trials remain, but new methods and software are available to improve their function and incorporation into cancer clinical research.

Two critical factors in the mixed-format test design (i.e., the order and proportion of polytomous items) and item selection were addressed in the context of mixed-format bifactor MCAT. For item selection, this article presents the derivation of the Fisher information matrix of the bifactor graded response model and the application of the bifactor dimension reduction method to simplify the computation of the mutual information (MI) item selection method. In a simulation study, different MCAT designs were compared with varying proportions of polytomous items (0.2-0.6, 1), different item-delivering formats (DPmix: delivering polytomous items at the final stage; RPmix: random delivering), three bifactor patterns (low, middle, and high), and two item selection methods (Bayesian D-optimality and MI). Simulation results suggested that a) the overall estimation precision increased with a higher bifactor pattern; b) the two item selection methods did not show substantial differences in estimation precision; and c) the RPmix format always led to more precise interim and final estimates than the DPmix format. The proportions of 0.3 and 0.4 were recommended for the RPmix and DPmix formats, respectively.

Integrating transcriptomics and MR, this study provides a current reference for the clinical treatment of DR by identifying potential drug targets in adaptive immune response-associated genes (AIR-RGs). Methods: The GSE102485 dataset about AIR-RGs and DR was downloaded from a public database. Initially, the MR and Steiger test identified AIR-related candidate genes with causal associations to DR. Bayesian co-localization analysis pinpointed DR drug targets, followed by phenotype scanning for side effects. Functional enrichment and immune infiltration analyses elucidated target mechanisms in DR. Results: Identified 27 AIR-RGs associated with DR, with TRAV23DV6 (OR = 1.367, 95 % CI = 1.005-1.859, p = 0.0046) as a risk factor. Co-localization analysis confirmed TRAV23DV6's potential as a DR drug target. Phenotype scanning linked TRAV23DV6 to hepatocellular carcinoma, thromboembolism, and pyelonephritis, indicating potential side effects. TRAV23DV6 engages in adaptive immunity, autophagy, and antigen binding. DR involves infiltration of 22 immune cell types and activation of 16 immune functions related to TCR, BCR pathways, and TNF family. Correlation analysis shows high TRAV23DV6 expression, immune cell infiltration, and function activation may exacerbate DR. Conclusion: TRAV23DV6 has been identified as a potential drug target for DR, offering a new perspective for the treatment of this condition.

We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) of different embolization options for unresectable HCC. Methods: Medical databases were searched for randomized controlled trials evaluating bland transarterial embolization (TAE), conventional TACE, drug-eluting bead chemoembolization (DEB-TACE), or transarterial radioembolization (TARE), either alone or combined with adjuvant chemotherapy, or local liver ablation, or external radiotherapy for unresectable HCC up to June 2017. Random effects Bayesian models with a binomial and normal likelihood were fitted (WinBUGS). Primary endpoint was patient survival expressed as hazard ratios (HR) and 95% credible intervals. An exponential model was used to fit patient survival curves. Safety and objective response were calculated as odds ratios (OR) and accompanying 95% credible intervals. Competing treatments were ranked with the SUCRA statistic. Heterogeneity-adjusted effective sample sizes were calculated to evaluate information size for each comparison. Quality of evidence (QoE) was assessed with the GRADE system adapted for NMA reports. All analyses complied with the ISPOR-AMCP-NCP Task Force Report for good practice in NMA. Findings: The network of evidence included 55 RCTs (12 direct comparisons) with 5,763 patients with preserved liver function and unresectable HCC (intermediate to advanced stage). All embolization strategies achieved a significant survival gain over control treatment (HR range, 0.42-0.76; very low-to-moderate QoE). However, TACE, DEB-TACE, TARE and adjuvant systemic agents did not confer any survival benefit over bland TAE alone (moderate QoE, except low in case of TARE). There was moderate QoE that TACE combined with external radiation or liver ablation achieved the best patient survival (SUCRA 86% and 96%, respectively). Estimated median survival was 13.9 months in control, 18.1 months in TACE, 20.6 months with DEB-TACE, 20.8 months with bland TAE, 30.1 months in TACE plus external radiotherapy, and 33.3 months in TACE plus liver ablation. TARE was the safest treatment (SUCRA 77%), however, all examined therapies were associated with a significantly higher risk of toxicity over control (OR range, 6.35 to 68.5). TACE, DEB-TACE, TARE and adjuvant systemic agents did not improve objective response over bland embolization alone (OR range, 0.85 to 1.65). There was clinical diversity among included randomized controlled trials, but statistical heterogeneity was low. Conclusions: Chemo- and radio-embolization for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma may improve tumour objective response and patient survival, but are not more effective than bland particle embolization. Chemoembolization combined with external radiotherapy or local liver ablation may significantly improve tumour response and patient survival rates over embolization monotherapies. Quality of evidence remains mostly low to moderate because of clinical diversity. Systematic review registration: CRD42016035796 (http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO).",,Y,,,

Rationale and Design,32267771,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32267771,"Abstract There is broad interest in improved methods to generate robust evidence regarding best practice, especially in settings where patient conditions are heterogenous and require multiple concomitant therapies. Here, we present the rationale and design of a large, international trial that combines features of adaptive platform trials with pragmatic point-of-care trials to determine best treatment strategies for patients admitted to an intensive care unit with severe community-acquired pneumonia. The trial uses a novel design, entitled ""a randomized embedded multifactorial adaptive platform."" The design has five key features: 1) randomization, allowing robust causal inference; 2) embedding of study procedures into routine care processes, facilitating enrollment, trial efficiency, and generalizability; 3) a multifactorial statistical model comparing multiple interventions across multiple patient subgroups; 4) response-adaptive randomization with preferential assignment to those interventions that appear most favorable; and 5) a platform structured to permit continuous, potentially perpetual enrollment beyond the evaluation of the initial treatments. The trial randomizes patients to multiple interventions within four treatment domains: antibiotics, antiviral therapy for influenza, host immunomodulation with extended macrolide therapy, and alternative corticosteroid regimens, representing 240 treatment regimens. The trial generates estimates of superiority, inferiority, and equivalence between regimens on the primary outcome of 90-day mortality, stratified by presence or absence of concomitant shock and proven or suspected influenza infection. The trial will also compare ventilatory and oxygenation strategies, and has capacity to address additional questions rapidly during pandemic respiratory infections. As of January 2020, REMAP-CAP (Randomized Embedded Multifactorial Adaptive Platform for Community-acquired Pneumonia) was approved and enrolling patients in 52 intensive care units in 13 countries on 3 continents. In February, it transitioned into pandemic mode with several design adaptations for coronavirus disease 2019.

The design is motivated by a trial to evaluate targeted agents for treating metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma, where a prognostic risk score defined by clinical variables and biomarkers is well established. Two clinical outcomes are used for dose-finding, time-to-toxicity during a prespecified follow-up period, and efficacy characterized by ordinal disease status evaluated at the end of follow-up. A joint probability model is constructed for these outcomes as functions of dose and subgroup. The model performs adaptive clustering of adjacent subgroups having similar dose-outcome distributions to facilitate borrowing information across subgroups. To quantify toxicity-efficacy risk-benefit trade-offs that may differ between subgroups, the objective function is based on outcome utilities elicited separately for each subgroup. In the context of the renal cancer trial, a design is constructed and a simulation study is presented to evaluate the design's reliability, safety, and robustness, and to compare it to designs that either ignore subgroups or run a separate trial within each subgroup.

In our randomized, multi-site, double-blind superiority trial using a Bayesian adaptive design, we demonstrated that 1000 mg/day of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was superior to 200 mg/day in preventing both early preterm birth (less than 34 weeks' gestation) and preterm birth (less than 37 weeks' gestation). The goal of this secondary study is to compare the effects of 1000 mg/day versus 200 mg/day on maternal inflammation, a possible mechanism by which DHA may prevent preterm birth. Maternal blood samples were collected at enrollment (12-20 weeks' gestation) and at delivery. Red blood cell DHA levels were measured by gas chromatography, and plasma concentrations of sRAGE, IL-6, IL-1?, TNF?, and INF? were measured by ELISA. Data were analyzed for associations with the DHA dose, gestational age at birth, and preterm birth (<37 weeks). Higher baseline and lower delivery levels of maternal sRAGE were associated with a greater probability of longer gestation and delivery at term gestation. Higher-dose DHA supplementation increased the probability of a smaller decrease in delivery sRAGE levels. Higher IL-6 concentrations at delivery were associated with the probability of delivering after 37 weeks, and higher-dose DHA supplementation increased the probability of greater increases in IL-6 concentrations between enrollment and delivery. These data provide a proposed mechanistic explanation of how a higher dose of DHA during pregnancy provides immunomodulatory regulation in the initiation of parturition by influencing sRAGE and IL-6 levels, which may explain its ability to reduce the risk of preterm birth.

ASTIN (Acute Stroke Therapy by Inhibition of Neutrophils) was an adaptive phase 2 dose-response-finding, proof-of-concept study to establish whether UK-279,276 improves recovery in acute ischemic stroke. The prime objective was to determine the dose that gave a clinically relevant effect in patients. Methods: A Bayesian sequential design with real-time efficacy data capture and continuous reassessment of the dose response allowed double-blind, randomized, adaptive allocation to 1 of 15 doses (dose range, 10 to 120 mg) or placebo and early termination for efficacy or futility. The primary end point was change from baseline to day 90 on the Scandinavian Stroke Scale (DeltaSSS), adjusted for baseline SSS, aiming for a 3-point additional mean recovery above placebo. Results: Nine hundred sixty-six acute stroke patients (887 ischemic, 204 cotreated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator; mean baseline SSS score, 28; range, 10 to 40) were treated within 6 hours of symptom onset. Mean DeltaSSS was approximately +17 points of improvement on SSS for the overall evaluable population. There was no treatment effect for UK-279,276 (posterior probability of futility, 0.89). The trial was stopped early for futility. Post hoc analysis indicated a mean 1.6-point additional improvement on DeltaSSS in the tissue plasminogen activator-treated subset (credible interval=0.5, 2.6). UK-279,276 was generally well tolerated, with no increased incidence of infections. Conclusions: UK-279,276 did not improve recovery in acute ischemic stroke patients but was devoid of serious side effects. The adaptive design facilitated early termination for futility.",,Y,,,

Methods: Test stimuli were four dynamic random-dot stereograms, one of which contained a disparate target. Feedback was given after each trial presentation. A Bayesian adaptive staircase adjusted target disparity. Threshold was estimated from the mean of the posterior distribution after 20 responses. Viewing distance was monitored via a forehead sticker viewed by the tablet's front camera, and screen parallax was adjusted dynamically so as to achieve the desired retinal disparity. Results: The tablet must be viewed at a distance of greater than ?35 cm to produce a good depth percept. Log thresholds were roughly normally distributed with a mean of 1.75 log10 arcsec = 56 arcsec and SD of 0.34 log10 arcsec = a factor of 2.2. The standard deviation agrees with previous studies, but ASTEROID thresholds are approximately 1.5 times higher than a similar stereotest on stereoscopic 3D TV or on Randot Preschool stereotests. Pearson correlation between successive tests in same observer was 0.80. Bland-Altman 95% limits of reliability were ±0.64 log10 arcsec = a factor of 4.3, corresponding to an SD of 0.32 log10 arcsec on individual threshold estimates. This is similar to other stereotests and close to the statistical limit for 20 responses. Conclusions: ASTEROID is reliable, easy, and portable and thus well-suited for clinical stereoacuity measurements.

The proposed model manages a semicontinuous variable by splitting it into two random variables: a binary indicator for determining the occurrence of excess zeros at all occasions and a continuous random variable for examining its actual level. For the continuous longitudinal response, an HMM is proposed to describe the relationship between the observation and unobservable finite-state transition processes. The HMM consists of two major components. The first component is a transition model for investigating how potential covariates influence the probabilities of transitioning from one hidden state to another. The second component is a conditional regression model for examining the state-specific effects of covariates on the response. A shared random effect is introduced to each part of the model to accommodate possible unobservable heterogeneity among observation processes and the nonignorability of missing covariates. A Bayesian adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) procedure is developed to conduct simultaneous variable selection and estimation. The proposed methodology is applied to a study on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. New insights into the pathology of Alzheimer's disease and its potential risk factors are obtained.

However, the overgeneralization of fear to harmless stimuli is maladaptive and assumed to contribute to anxiety disorders. Thus, elucidating factors that may modulate fear (over)generalization is important. Based on the known effects of acute stress on learning, which are at least partly due to noradrenergic arousal, we investigated whether stress may promote fear overgeneralization and whether we could counteract this effect by reducing noradrenergic arousal. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, between-subjects design, 120 healthy participants underwent a fear-conditioning procedure on Day 1. Approximately 24 hours later, participants received orally either a placebo or the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol and were exposed to a stress or control manipulation before they completed a test of fear generalization. Skin conductance responses as well as explicit rating data showed a successful acquisition of conditioned fear on Day 1 and a pronounced fear generalization 24 hours later. Although physiological data confirmed the successful stress manipulation and reduction of noradrenergic arousal, the extent of fear generalization remained unaffected by stress and propranolol. The absence of a stress effect on fear generalization was confirmed by a second study and a Bayesian analysis across both data sets. Our findings suggest that acute stress leaves fear generalization processes intact, at least in a sample of healthy, young individuals. Keywords: Fear generalization; Stress.",,Y,,,

Currently, CN is no longer the standard of care (SOC) based on the randomised phase 3 CARMENA study performed in the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor era. With the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) combination therapy in first line, the role of CN needs to be reassessed. There is indirect evidence from small retrospective series that deferred CN after ICI combination therapy may lead to better outcomes. To reassess the role of CN, we designed PrimerX, a randomised controlled trial following the Trial within Cohorts (TwiCs) study design. The primary objective of this study is to re-evaluate the benefit of deferred local treatment in the current era of immunotherapy. Study design: This PrimerX study has been designed as a TwiCs study within the Dutch Prospective Renal Cell Carcinoma (PRO-RCC) cohort. The PRO-RCC cohort includes patients with mRCC and nonmetastatic RCC, and has been set up for prospective collection of long-term clinical data and as an infrastructure for initiating TwiCs studies. The PrimerX TwiCs trial follows a Bayesian adaptive multistage design to allow for early discontinuation due to futility or efficacy. PrimerX has appropriate ethics approval and is registered at clinical.trials.gov (NCT05941169). End points: The primary clinical endpoint is overall survival, defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause. The secondary endpoint is the objective response rate within the primary tumour prior to local therapy, as assessed by a computed tomography scan. Patients and methods: A maximum of 700 patients with synchronous mRCC and absence of progression at metastatic sites following at least 6 mo of standard first-line ICI combination therapy will be assigned randomly to receive local treatment of the primary tumour (experimental arm) or SOC (control arm).

We report the design and operating characteristics of a proposed randomized Bayesian adaptive ""enrichment"" clinical trial designed to determine whether ECPR is effective for refractory OHCA and, if effective, to define the interval after arrest during which patients derive benefit. Methods: Through iterative trial simulation and trial design modification, we developed a Bayesian adaptive trial of ECPR for adults who experience non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Our proposed trial design addresses the threats to trial success identified during the design process, which were (1) the uncertainty surrounding the cardiac arrest (CA)-to-ECPR interval within which clinical benefit might be preserved (2) the difference in prognosis between patients with an initial rhythm that is non-shockable vs. shockable. Trial subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either standard care or expedited transport to a hospital for potential ECPR. The CA-to-ECPR interval will be estimated in real time based on the sum of the estimated paramedic response time (911 call to scene arrival), paramedic scene time, and transport time to hospital. A Bayesian decreasing step function will be used to estimate the efficacy of the treatment with an outcome of the 90-day utility-weighted Modified Rankin Scale (uwmRS) for each rhythm subgroup and estimated CA-to-ECPR interval at pre-specified interims. The trial will adaptively lengthen the estimated CA-to-ECPR eligibility window if the treatment appears effective at the upper limit of initial eligibility window. If ECPR appears ineffective at longer estimated CA-to-ECPR intervals, the upper limit of the window for enrollment eligibility will be shortened. The analysis will be stratified by rhythm subgroup. Results: With a maximum total sample size of 400, and a cap on the maximum sample size of 300 for the non-shockable rhythm subgroup, the trial design has power ranging from 91-100% to detect a benefit from ECPR for non-shockable rhythms under the various efficacy scenarios simulated and power ranging from 69-98% for shockable rhythms under the same scenarios. The trial design also has a high probability of correctly identifying the maximum CA-to-ECPR interval within which ECPR produces a clinically significant benefit of 0.2 on the uwMRS. If ECPR is equivalent to standard CA care, the type I error is 2.5% with a 99% probability of stopping enrollment early for futility in the non-shockable subgroup and a 97% probability of stopping enrollment early for futility in the shockable subgroup. Conclusion: This proposed adaptive trial design helps to ensure the population of patients who are most likely to benefit from treatment-as defined both by rhythm subgroup and estimated CA-to-ECPR interval-is enrolled. The design promotes early termination of the trial if continuation is likely to be futile. Keywords: Adaptive Trial Design; Cardiac Arrest; ECMO; ECPR.",,Y,,,

Studies exploring human inference as a dynamical process that unfolds in time have focused on situations in which the statistics of observations are history-independent. Yet, temporal structure is everywhere in nature and yields history-dependent observations. Do humans modify their inference processes depending on the latent temporal statistics of their observations? We investigate this question experimentally and theoretically using a change-point inference task. We show that humans adapt their inference process to fine aspects of the temporal structure in the statistics of stimuli. As such, humans behave qualitatively in a Bayesian fashion but, quantitatively, deviate away from optimality. Perhaps more importantly, humans behave suboptimally in that their responses are not deterministic, but variable. We show that this variability itself is modulated by the temporal statistics of stimuli. To elucidate the cognitive algorithm that yields this behavior, we investigate a broad array of existing and new models that characterize different sources of suboptimal deviations away from Bayesian inference. While models with ""output noise"" that corrupts the response-selection process are natural candidates, human behavior is best described by sampling-based inference models, in which the main ingredient is a compressed approximation of the posterior, represented through a modest set of random samples and updated over time. This result comes to complement a growing literature on sample-based representation and learning in humans. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).",,Y,,,

We assessed the influence of priors expressing a spectrum of scepticism on the performance of several Bayesian, multi-stage, adaptive clinical trial designs using binary outcomes under different clinical scenarios. Simulations were conducted using fixed stopping rules and stopping rules calibrated to keep type 1 error rates at approximately 5%. We assessed total sample sizes, event rates, event counts, probabilities of conclusiveness and selecting the best arm, root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of the estimated treatment effect in the selected arms, and ideal design percentages (IDPs; which combines arm selection probabilities, power, and consequences of selecting inferior arms), with RMSEs and IDPs estimated in conclusive trials only and after selecting the control arm in inconclusive trials. Using fixed stopping rules, increasingly sceptical priors led to larger sample sizes, more events, higher IDPs in simulations ending in superiority, and lower RMSEs, lower probabilities of conclusiveness/selecting the best arm, and lower IDPs when selecting controls in inconclusive simulations. With calibrated stopping rules, the effects of increased scepticism on sample sizes and event counts were attenuated, and increased scepticism increased the probabilities of conclusiveness/selecting the best arm and IDPs when selecting controls in inconclusive simulations without substantially increasing sample sizes. Results from trial designs with gentle adaptation and non-informative priors resembled those from designs with more aggressive adaptation using weakly-to-moderately sceptical priors. In conclusion, the use of somewhat sceptical priors in adaptive trial designs with binary outcomes seems reasonable when considering multiple performance metrics simultaneously.

When designing these studies, the expected Fisher information matrix (FIM) can be used instead of performing time-consuming clinical trial simulations. The function PFIM is the first tool for design evaluation and optimization that has been developed in R. In this article, we present an extended version, PFIM 4.0, which includes several new features. Methods: Compared with version 3.0, PFIM 4.0 includes a more complete pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic library of models and accommodates models including additional random effects for inter-occasion variability as well as discrete covariates. A new input method has been added to specify user-defined models through an R function. Optimization can be performed assuming some fixed parameters or some fixed sampling times. New outputs have been added regarding the FIM such as eigenvalues, conditional numbers, and the option of saving the matrix obtained after evaluation or optimization. Previously obtained results, which are summarized in a FIM, can be taken into account in evaluation or optimization of one-group protocols. This feature enables the use of PFIM for adaptive designs. The Bayesian individual FIM has been implemented, taking into account a priori distribution of random effects. Designs for maximum a posteriori Bayesian estimation of individual parameters can now be evaluated or optimized and the predicted shrinkage is also reported. It is also possible to visualize the graphs of the model and the sensitivity functions without performing evaluation or optimization. Results: The usefulness of these approaches and the simplicity of use of PFIM 4.0 are illustrated by two examples: (i) an example of designing a population pharmacokinetic study accounting for previous results, which highlights the advantage of adaptive designs; (ii) an example of Bayesian individual design optimization for a pharmacodynamic study, showing that the Bayesian individual FIM can be a useful tool in therapeutic drug monitoring, allowing efficient prediction of estimation precision and shrinkage for individual parameters. Conclusion: PFIM 4.0 is a useful tool for design evaluation and optimization of longitudinal studies in pharmacometrics and is freely available at http://www.pfim.biostat.fr.

Historical data, when perfectly commensurate with current data, have been shown to reduce the trial duration and the sample size, while inflation in the type I error and reduction in the power have been reported, when imperfectly commensurate. These results, however, were obtained without considering that Bayesian designs are calibrated to meet regulatory requirements in practice and even no-borrowing designs may use information from historical data in the calibration. The implicit borrowing of historical data suggests that imperfectly commensurate historical data may similarly impact no-borrowing designs negatively. We will provide a fair appraiser of Bayesian dynamic borrowing and no-borrowing designs. We used a published selective adaptive randomization design and real clinical trial setting and conducted simulation studies under varying degrees of imperfectly commensurate historical control scenarios. The type I error was inflated under the null scenario of no intervention effect, while larger inflation was noted with borrowing. The larger inflation in type I error under the null setting can be offset by the greater probability to stop early correctly under the alternative. Response rates were estimated more precisely and the average sample size was smaller with borrowing. The expected increase in bias with borrowing was noted, but was negligible. Using Bayesian dynamic borrowing designs may improve trial efficiency by stopping trials early correctly and reducing trial length at the small cost of inflated type I error.

Unlike in other therapeutic areas where multiple doses are evaluated thoroughly in dose ranging studies, early-phase oncology dose-finding studies are characterized by the practice of identifying a single dose, such as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Following the spirit of Project Optimus, we propose an Multi-Arm Two-Stage (MATS) design for proof-of-concept (PoC) and dose optimization that allows the evaluation of two selected doses from a dose-escalation trial. The design assesses the higher dose first across multiple indications in the first stage, and adaptively enters the second stage for an indication if the higher dose exhibits promising anti-tumor activities. In the second stage, a randomized comparison between the higher and lower doses is conducted to achieve PoC and dose optimization. A Bayesian hierarchical model governs the statistical inference and decision making by borrowing information across doses, indications, and stages. Our simulation studies show that the proposed MATS design yield desirable performance. An R Shiny application has been developed and made available at https://matsdesign.shinyapps.io/mats/.

The practical solution is often to increase the efficiency of this sample size by selecting a pair of treatments among the pool of promising treatments before the clinical trial begins. The problem with this approach is that the investigator may inadvertently leave out the most beneficial treatment. This paper demonstrates a possible solution to this problem by using Bayesian adaptive designs. We use a planned comparative effectiveness clinical trial of treatments for sialorrhea in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as an example of the approach. Rather than having to guess at the two best treatments to compare based on limited data, we suggest putting more arms in the trial and letting response adaptive randomization (RAR) determine better arms. To ground this study relative to previous literature we first compare RAR, adaptive equal randomization (ER), arm(s) dropping, and a fixed design. Given the goals of this trial we demonstrate that we may avoid 'type III errors' - inadvertently leaving out the best treatment - with little loss in power compared to a two-arm design, even when choosing the correct two arms for the two-armed design. There are appreciable gains in power when the two arms are prescreened at random.

Given excellent outcomes of human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated OPC and long-term survival of these typically young patients, treatment de-intensification aimed at improving survivorship while maintaining excellent disease control is now a central concern. The recent implementation of magnetic resonance image - guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) systems allows for individual tumor response assessment during treatment and offers possibility of personalized dose-reduction. In this 2-stage Bayesian phase II study, we propose to examine weekly radiotherapy dose-adaptation based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluated tumor response. Individual patient's plan will be designed to optimize dose reduction to organs at risk and minimize locoregional failure probability based on serial MRI during RT. Our primary aim is to assess the non-inferiority of MRgRT dose adaptation for patients with low risk HPV-associated OPC compared to historical control, as measured by Bayesian posterior probability of locoregional control (LRC). Methods: Patients with T1-2 N0-2b (as per AJCC 7th Edition) HPV-positive OPC, with lymph node <3 cm and <10 pack-year smoking history planned for curative radiotherapy alone to a dose of 70 Gy in 33 fractions will be eligible. All patients will undergo pre-treatment MRI and at least weekly intra-treatment MRI. Patients undergoing MRgRT will have weekly adaptation of high dose planning target volume based on gross tumor volume response. The stage 1 of this study will enroll 15 patients to MRgRT dose adaptation. If LRC at 6 months with MRgRT dose adaptation is found sufficiently safe as per the Bayesian model, stage 2 of the protocol will expand enrollment to an additional 60 patients, randomized to either MRgRT or standard IMRT. Discussion: Multiple methods for safe treatment de-escalation in patients with HPV-positive OPC are currently being studied. By leveraging the ability of advanced MRI techniques to visualize tumor and soft tissues through the course of treatment, this protocol proposes a workflow for safe personalized radiation dose-reduction in good responders with radiosensitive tumors, while ensuring tumoricidal dose to more radioresistant tumors. MRgRT dose adaptation could translate in reduced long term radiation toxicities and improved survivorship while maintaining excellent LRC outcomes in favorable OPC.

The design is motivated by settings where prior biological information indicates it is certain that efficacy will improve with ordinal subgroup level. We formulate a flexible Bayesian hierarchical model to account for associations among subgroups and regimes, and to characterize ordered subgroup effects. Sequentially adaptive decision-making is complicated by the problem, arising from the motivating application, that efficacy is scored on day 90 and toxicity is evaluated within 30 days from the start of therapy, while the patient accrual rate is fast relative to these outcome evaluation intervals. To deal with this in a practical manner, we take a likelihood-based approach that treats unobserved toxicity and efficacy outcomes as missing values, and use elicited utilities that quantify the efficacy-toxicity trade-off as a decision criterion. Adaptive randomization is used to assign patients to regimes while accounting for subgroups, with randomization probabilities depending on the posterior predictive distributions of utilities. A simulation study is presented to evaluate the design's performance under a variety of scenarios, and to assess its sensitivity to the amount of missing data, the prior, and model misspecification.

The Investigation of Serial studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with Imaging And moLecular Analysis (ISPY COVID-19 trial) was designed and implemented in early 2020 to evaluate investigational agents rapidly and simultaneously on a phase 2 adaptive platform. This manuscript outlines the design, rationale, implementation and challenges of the ISPY COVID-19 trial during the first phase of trial activity from April 2020 until December 2021. Methods and analysis: The ISPY COVID-19 Trial is a multicentre open-label phase 2 platform trial in the USA designed to evaluate therapeutics that may have a large effect on improving outcomes from severe COVID-19. The ISPY COVID-19 Trial network includes academic and community hospitals with significant geographical diversity across the country. Enrolled patients are randomised to receive one of up to four investigational agents or a control and are evaluated for a family of two primary outcomes-time to recovery and mortality. The statistical design uses a Bayesian model with 'stopping' and 'graduation' criteria designed to efficiently discard ineffective therapies and graduate promising agents for definitive efficacy trials. Each investigational agent arm enrols to a maximum of 125 patients per arm and is compared with concurrent controls. As of December 2021, 11 investigational agent arms had been activated, and 8 arms were complete. Enrolment and adaptation of the trial design are ongoing.

Despite their increasing popularity and application, the specification of these models necessitates a great deal of care when analysing longitudinal data with non-linear patterns and asymmetry. Parametric (linear) mixed-effect models may not capture these complexities flexibly and adequately. Additionally, assuming a Gaussian distribution for random effects and/or model errors may be overly restrictive, as it lacks robustness against deviations from symmetry. Methods: This paper presents a semiparametric mixed-effects model with flexible distributions for complex longitudinal data in the Bayesian paradigm. The non-linear time effect on the longitudinal response was modelled using a spline approach. The multivariate skew-t distribution, which is a more flexible distribution, is utilized to relax the normality assumptions associated with both random-effects and model errors. Results: To assess the effectiveness of the proposed methods in various model settings, simulation studies were conducted. We then applied these models on chronic kidney disease (CKD) data and assessed the relationship between covariates and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). First, we compared the proposed semiparametric partially linear mixed-effect (SPPLM) model with the fully parametric one (FPLM), and the results indicated that the SPPLM model outperformed the FPLM model. We then further compared four different SPPLM models, each assuming different distributions for the random effects and model errors. The model with a skew-t distribution exhibited a superior fit to the CKD data compared to the Gaussian model. The findings from the application revealed that hypertension, diabetes, and follow-up time had a substantial association with kidney function, specifically leading to a decrease in GFR estimates. Conclusions: The application and simulation studies have demonstrated that our work has made a significant contribution towards a more robust and adaptable methodology for modeling intricate longitudinal data. We achieved this by proposing a semiparametric Bayesian modeling approach with a spline smoothing function and a skew-t distribution.

Phase 1 assessed whether 4 weeks of contingency management (CM) improved response with the addition of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). Phase 2 assessed pharmacological augmentation with modafinil (MOD) vs. placebo (PLA) for individuals not achieving abstinence during Phase 1. Method: For Phase 1 of treatment, participants (N=118) were randomly allocated to ACT+CM or Drug Counseling (DC+CM), the comparison condition. At week 4, treatment response was defined as the submission of six consecutive cocaine-negative urine drug screens (UDS). Phase 1 non-responders were re-randomized to MOD or PLA as adjunct to their initial treatment. Phase 1 responders continued receiving their initial treatment. Primary outcomes included response rate and proportion of cocaine-negative UDS for Phase 1 and 2. Analyses used Bayesian inference with 80% pre-specified as the posterior probability (PP) threshold constituting moderate evidence that an effect exists. Results: Phase 1 response was higher in the ACT+CM group (24.5%) compared to the DC+CM group (17.5%; PP = 84.5%). In Phase 2, the proportion of cocaine-negative UDS among Phase 1 responders did not differ by initial treatment (PP = 61.8%) but remained higher overall compared to Phase 1 non-responders (PPs > 99%). No evidence of an effect favoring augmentation with MOD was observed. Discussion: Adding ACT to CM increased abstinence initiation. Initial responders were more likely to remain abstinent compared to initial non-responders, for whom modafinil was not an effective pharmacotherapy augmentation strategy.

NIR spectroscopy is utilized to analyze four key factors (water, sugars, amino acids content, and genes) associated with maize seed drought responses. Signature NIR bands indicative of drought resistance-related molecules are identified using the Competitive Adaptive Reweighted Sampling (CARS) technique. Furthermore, an Improved Discrete Bayesian Optimization Support Vector Machine (ID-BOA-SVM) classification model is developed to address issues related to sparse features in traditional Bayesian Optimization Support Vector Machines (BOA-SVM). To enhance classification performance, a stacking model integrating Random Forest (RF), ID-BOA-SVM, Logistic Regression (LR), and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) classifiers is constructed, ensuring robustness and minimizing overfitting risks. The model achieves satisfactory recognition accuracy (94.28% accuracy, 94% precision, 94.61% recall, and 94.23% F1-score) even under conditions of substantial interference and dataset variability.

In 2022, the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence initiated Project Optimus to reform the paradigm of dose optimization and dose selection in oncology drug development and issued a draft guidance. The guidance suggests that dose-finding trials include randomized dose-response cohorts of multiple doses and incorporate information on pharmacokinetics (PK) in addition to safety and efficacy data to select the OD. Furthermore, PK information could be a quick alternative to efficacy data to predict the minimum efficacious dose and decide the dose assignment. This article proposes a model-based trial design for dose optimization with a randomization scheme based on PK outcomes in oncology.

We assessed the influence of different outcome-data lags (0-105 days) on the performance of various multi-stage, adaptive trial designs (2/4 arms, with/without a common control, fixed/response-adaptive randomisation) with undesirable binary outcomes according to different inclusion rates (3.33/6.67/10 patients/day) under scenarios with no, small, and large differences. Simulations were conducted under a Bayesian framework, with constant stopping thresholds for superiority/inferiority calibrated to keep type-1 error rates at approximately 5%. We assessed multiple performance metrics, including mean sample sizes, event counts/probabilities, probabilities of conclusiveness, root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of the estimated effect in the selected arms, and RMSEs between the analyses at the time of stopping and the final analyses including data from all randomised patients. Performance metrics generally deteriorated when the proportions of randomised patients with available data were smaller due to longer outcome-data lags or faster inclusion, that is, mean sample sizes, event counts/probabilities, and RMSEs were larger, while the probabilities of conclusiveness were lower. Performance metric impairments with outcome-data lags ?45 days were relatively smaller compared to those occurring with ?60 days of lag. For most metrics, the effects of different outcome-data lags and lower proportions of randomised patients with available data were larger than those of different design choices, for example, the use of fixed versus response-adaptive randomisation.

Identification of subgroups of people with LBP who may benefit from these different treatment approaches is an important research priority. Aim and objectives: To improve the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of LBP treatment by providing patients, their clinical advisors and health-service purchasers with better information about which participants are most likely to benefit from which treatment choices. Our objectives were to synthesise what is already known about the validity, reliability and predictive value of possible treatment moderators (patient factors that predict response to treatment) for therapist-delivered interventions; develop a repository of individual participant data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) testing therapist-delivered interventions for LBP; determine which participant characteristics, if any, predict clinical response to different treatments for LBP; and determine which participant characteristics, if any, predict the most cost-effective treatments for LBP. Achieving these objectives required substantial methodological work, including the development and evaluation of some novel statistical approaches. This programme of work was not designed to analyse the main effect of interventions and no such interpretations should be made. Methods: First, we reviewed the literature on treatment moderators and subgroups. We initially invited investigators of trials of therapist-delivered interventions for LBP with > 179 participants to share their data with us; some further smaller trials that were offered to us were also included. Using these trials we developed a repository of individual participant data of therapist-delivered interventions for LBP. Using this data set we sought to identify which participant characteristics, if any, predict response to different treatments (moderators) for clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness outcomes. We undertook an analysis of covariance to identify potential moderators to apply in our main analyses. Subsequently, we developed and applied three methods of subgroup identification: recursive partitioning (interaction trees and subgroup identification based on a differential effect search); adaptive risk group refinement; and an individual participant data indirect network meta-analysis (NWMA) to identify subgroups defined by multiple parameters. Results: We included data from 19 RCTs with 9328 participants (mean age 49 years, 57% females). Our prespecified analyses using recursive partitioning and adaptive risk group refinement performed well and allowed us to identify some subgroups. The differences in the effect size in the different subgroups were typically small and unlikely to be clinically meaningful. Increasing baseline severity on the outcome of interest was the strongest driver of subgroup identification that we identified. Additionally, we explored the application of Bayesian indirect NWMA. This method produced varying probabilities that a particular treatment choice would be most likely to be effective for a specific patient profile. Conclusions: These data lack clinical effectiveness or cost-effectiveness justification for the use of baseline characteristics in the development of subgroups for back pain. The methodological developments from this work have the potential to be applied in other clinical areas. The pooled repository database will serve as a valuable resource to the LBP research community. Funding: The National Institute for Health Research Programme Grants for Applied Research programme.

We conducted a Bayesian analysis of the entire TAILOR-PCI (Tailored Antiplatelet Initiation to Lessen Outcomes Due to Decreased Clopidogrel Response After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) randomized clinical trial population to evaluate the effect of the genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy post-PCI compared with the usual care on the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Methods: The primary outcome for our study was the composite of MACE (myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death). Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular death, stroke, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and major/minor bleeding. Bayesian modeling was used to estimate the probability of clinical benefit of genotype-guided therapy using (1) noninformative priors (ie, analyzing the TAILOR-PCI trial) and (2) informative priors derived from the ADAPT, POPular Genetics, IAC-PCI, and PHARMCLO trials (ie, analyzing TAILOR-PCI trial in the context of prior evidence). Risk ratio (RR: ratio of cumulative outcome incidence between genotype-guided and conventional therapy group) and 95% credible interval (CrI) were estimated for the study outcomes, and probability estimates for RR <1 were computed. Results: Using noninformative priors, in TAILOR-PCI the RR for MACE was 0.78 (95% CrI, 0.55-1.07) in genotype-guided therapy after PCI, and the probability of RR <1 was 94%.

ADAPT-IT uses the National Institute of Neurologic Disorders & Stroke-supported Neurological Emergencies Treatment Trials (NETT) network as a 'laboratory' in which to study the development of adaptive clinical trial designs in the confirmatory setting. The Stroke Hyperglycemia Insulin Network Effort (SHINE) trial was selected for funding by the NIH-NINDS at the start of ADAPT-IT and is currently an ongoing phase III trial of tight glucose control in hyperglycemic acute ischemic stroke patients. Within ADAPT-IT, a Bayesian adaptive Goldilocks trial design alternative was developed. Methods: The SHINE design includes response adaptive randomization, a sample size re-estimation, and monitoring for early efficacy and futility according to a group sequential design. The Goldilocks design includes more frequent monitoring for predicted success or futility and a longitudinal model of the primary endpoint. Both trial designs were simulated and compared in terms of their mean sample size and power across a range of treatment effects and success rates for the control group. Results: As simulated, the SHINE design tends to have slightly higher power and the Goldilocks design has a lower mean sample size. Both designs were tuned to have approximately 80% power to detect a difference of 25% versus 32% between control and treatment, respectively. In this scenario, mean sample sizes are 1,114 and 979 for the SHINE and Goldilocks designs, respectively. Conclusions: Two designs were brought forward, and both were evaluated, revised, and improved based on the input of all parties involved in the ADAPT-IT process. However, the SHINE investigators were tasked with choosing only a single design to implement and ultimately elected not to implement the Goldilocks design. The Goldilocks design will be retrospectively executed upon completion of SHINE to later compare the designs based on their use of patient resources, time, and conclusions in a real world setting.

Noradrenaline (NA) is hypothesized to play a key role in coordinating the sensory, learning, and physiological states necessary to adapt to a changing world, but direct evidence for this is lacking in humans. Here, we tested the effects of attenuating noradrenergic neurotransmission on learning under uncertainty. We probed the effects of the ?-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (40 mg) using a between-subjects, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Participants performed a probabilistic associative learning task, and we employed a hierarchical learning model to formally quantify prediction errors about cue-outcome contingencies and changes in these associations over time (volatility). Both unexpectedness and noise slowed down reaction times, but propranolol augmented the interaction between these main effects such that behavior was influenced more by prior expectations when uncertainty was high. Computationally, this was driven by a reduction in learning rates, with people slower to update their beliefs in the face of new information. Attenuating the global effects of NA also eliminated the phasic effects of prediction error and volatility on pupil size, consistent with slower belief updating. Finally, estimates of environmental volatility were predicted by baseline cardiac measures in all participants. Our results demonstrate that NA underpins behavioral and computational responses to uncertainty. These findings have important implications for understanding the impact of uncertainty on human biology and cognition.

Noise introduced at initial encoding and during maintenance degrades the precision of representation. Stimulus estimation is also biased away from recently encountered stimuli, a phenomenon known as adaptation. Within a Bayesian framework, greater biases are predicted to result from poor precision. We tested for this effect on individual difference measures. Through an online experiment, 202 subjects contributed data. During separate face and color blocks, they performed three different tasks: an immediate stimulus match, a delayed match-to-sample, and a delayed match following 5 s of adaptation. The stimulus spaces were circular, and subjects entered their responses on a color/face wheel. Bias and precision of responses were extracted while accounting for the probability of random guesses. We found that the adaptation manipulation induced the expected bias in responses, and the magnitude of this bias varied reliably and substantially between subjects. Across subjects, there was a negative correlation between mean precision and bias. This relationship was replicated in a new experiment with 192 subjects. This result is consistent with a Bayesian observer model, in which the precision of perceptual representation influences the magnitude of perceptual bias.",,Y,,,

Of particular concern is that the rate of earliest preterm birth (<34 weeks) (ePTB), which has decreased little since 1990 and has the greatest impact on the overall infant mortality, resulting in the greatest cost to society. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation provides a potential high yield, low risk strategy to reduce early preterm delivery in the US by up to 75%. We propose a Phase III Clinical Trial (randomized to low or high dose DHA, double-blinded) to examine the efficacy and safety of high dose DHA supplementation to reduce ePTB. We also plan for a secondary pregnancy efficacy analysis to determine if there is a subset of pregnancies most likely to benefit from DHA supplementation. Methods: Between 900 and 1200 pregnant women who are ? 18 years old and between 12 and 20 weeks gestation will be recruited from three trial experienced academic medical institutions. Participants will be randomly assigned to two daily capsules of algal oil (totaling 800 mg DHA) or soybean and corn oil (0 mg DHA). Both groups will receive a commercially available prenatal supplement containing 200 mg DHA. Therefore, the experimental group will receive 1000 mg DHA/d and the control group 200 mg DHA/d. We will then employ a novel Bayesian response adaptive randomization design that assigns more subjects to the ""winning"" group and potentially allows for substantially smaller sample size while providing a stronger conclusion regarding the most effective group. The study has an overall Type I error rate of 5% and a power of 90%. Participants are followed throughout pregnancy and delivery for safety and delivery outcomes. Discussion: We hypothesize that DHA will decrease the frequency of ePTB <34 weeks. Reducing ePTB is clinically important as these earliest preterm deliveries carry the highest risk of neonatal morbidity, as well as contribute significant stress for families and post a large societal burden.

Sorafenib was tested on patients with tumors harboring sorafenib-targeted genes. Methods: The MOST-plus trial used a randomized discontinuation design. After 12 weeks of sorafenib (400 mg, po BID), patients with progressive disease discontinued study, patients with objective response were proposed to continue sorafenib, whereas patients with stable disease (SD) were randomly assigned (1:1) to the maintenance or interruption of treatment. The primary endpoint was RECIST version 1.1 progression-free rate at 16 weeks after randomization (PFR-16w). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity. Statistical analyses used a sequential Bayesian approach with interim efficacy analyses. The enrolment could be stopped in the case of a 95% probability for the estimated PFR-16w to be higher in the maintenance than in the interruption arm (NCT02029001). Results: 151 patients were included, of whom 35 had SD at 12 weeks of Sorafenib. For the 35 patients with SD on sorafenib, the PFR-16w was 65% [95% credibility interval 43.4-83.7] in the continuation arm and 25% [7.8-48.1] in the interruption arm.

This network meta-analysis (NMA) aimed to assess the comparative efficacy of ustekinumab, adalimumab, vedolizumab and infliximab in the maintenance of clinical response and remission after 1 year of treatment. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Key outcomes of interest were clinical response (CD activity index [CDAI] reduction of 100 points; CDAI-100) and remission (CDAI score under 150 points; CDAI < 150). A treatment sequence Bayesian NMA was conducted to account for the re-randomization of patients based on different clinical definitions, the lack of similarity of the common comparator for each trial and the full treatment pathway from the induction phase onwards. Results: Thirteen RCTs were identified. Ustekinumab 90 mg q8w was associated with statistically significant improvement in clinical response relative to placebo and vedolizumab 300 mg. For clinical remission, ustekinumab 90 mg q8w was associated with statistically significant improvement relative to placebo and vedolizumab 300 mg q8w. Findings from sub-population analyses had similar results but were not statistically significant. Conclusions: The NMA suggest that ustekinumab is associated with the highest likelihood of reaching response or remission at 1 year compared with placebo, adalimumab and vedolizumab. Results should be interpreted with caution because this is a novel methodology; however, the treatment sequence analysis may be the most methodologically sound analysis to derive estimates of comparative efficacy in CD in the absence of head-to-head evidence.

Intravenous ketamine is the most commonly used sedative agent. However, intravenous insertion is painful and can be technically difficult in children. We hypothesise that a combination of intranasal dexmedetomidine plus intranasal ketamine (Ketodex) will be non-inferior to intravenous ketamine for effective sedation in children undergoing a closed reduction. Methods and analysis: This is a six-centre, four-arm, adaptive, randomised, blinded, controlled, non-inferiority trial. We will include children 4-17 years with a simple upper limb fracture or dislocation that requires sedation for a closed reduction. Participants will be randomised to receive either intranasal Ketodex (one of three dexmedetomidine and ketamine combinations) or intravenous ketamine. The primary outcome is adequate sedation as measured using the Paediatric Sedation State Scale. Secondary outcomes include length of stay, time to wakening and adverse effects. The results of both per protocol and intention-to-treat analyses will be reported for the primary outcome. All inferential analyses will be undertaken using a response-adaptive Bayesian design. Logistic regression will be used to model the dose-response relationship for the combinations of intranasal Ketodex. Using the Average Length Criterion for Bayesian sample size estimation, a survey-informed non-inferiority margin of 17.8% and priors from historical data, a sample size of 410 participants will be required.

Certain species have adapted to predictable anthropogenic food resources like landfills. However, abrupt shifts in food availability can negatively impact such populations. While changes in survival are expected, the age-related effects remain poorly understood, particularly in long-lived scavenger species. We investigated the age-specific demographic response of a Griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) population to a reduction in organic matter in a landfill and analyzed apparent survival and the probability of transience after initial capture using a Bayesian Cormack-Jolly-Seber model on data from 2012-2022. The proportion of transients among newly captured immatures and adults increased after the reduction in food. Juvenile apparent survival declined, increased in immature residents, and decreased in adult residents. These results suggest that there was a greater likelihood of permanent emigration due to intensified intraspecific competition following the reduction in food. Interestingly, resident immatures showed the opposite trend, suggesting the persistence of high-quality individuals despite the food scarcity. Although the reasons behind the reduced apparent survival of resident adults in the final four years of the study remain unclear, non-natural mortality potentially plays a part. In Europe landfill closure regulations are being implemented and pose a threat to avian scavenger populations, which underlines the need for research on food scarcity scenarios and proper conservation measures.

To attempt to obtain reliable estimates in a task-based experiment, each condition is usually repeated across many trials. The investigator may be interested in (a) condition-level effects, (b) trial-level effects, or (c) the association of trial-level effects with the corresponding behavior data. The typical strategy for condition-level modeling is to create one regressor per condition at the subject level with the underlying assumption that responses do not change across trials. In this methodology of complete pooling, all cross-trial variability is ignored and dismissed as random noise that is swept under the rug of model residuals. Unfortunately, this framework invalidates the generalizability from the confine of specific trials (e.g., particular faces) to the associated stimulus category (""face""), and may inflate the statistical evidence when the trial sample size is not large enough. Here we propose an adaptive and computationally tractable framework that meshes well with the current two-level pipeline and explicitly accounts for trial-by-trial variability. The trial-level effects are first estimated per subject through no pooling. To allow generalizing beyond the particular stimulus set employed, the cross-trial variability is modeled at the population level through partial pooling in a multilevel model, which permits accurate effect estimation and characterization. Alternatively, trial-level estimates can be used to investigate, for example, brain-behavior associations or correlations between brain regions. Furthermore, our approach allows appropriate accounting for serial correlation, handling outliers, adapting to data skew, and capturing nonlinear brain-behavior relationships. By applying a Bayesian multilevel model framework at the level of regions of interest to an experimental dataset, we show how multiple testing can be addressed and full results reported without arbitrary dichotomization. Our approach revealed important differences compared to the conventional method at the condition level, including how the latter can distort effect magnitude and precision. Notably, in some cases our approach led to increased statistical sensitivity. In summary, our proposed framework provides an effective strategy to capture trial-by-trial responses that should be of interest to a wide community of experimentalists.",,Y,,,

The mu-opioid receptor (MOR) system plays a key role in affiliation and social bonding. However, it remains unclear whether MORs are involved in the categorization and spontaneous mimicry of emotional facial expressions. Using a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, between-subjects design, we investigated in 82 healthy female volunteers the effects of the specific MOR agonist morphine on the recognition accuracy of emotional faces (happiness, anger, fear), and on their facial mimicry (measured with electromyography). Frequentist statistics did not reveal any significant effects of drug administration on facial mimicry or emotion recognition abilities. However, post hoc Bayesian analyses provided support for an effect of morphine on facial mimicry of fearful facial expressions. Specifically, compared to placebo, morphine reduced mimicry of fear, as shown by lower activity of the frontalis muscle. Bayesian analyses also provided support for the absence of a drug effect on mimicry of happy and angry facial expressions, which were assessed with the zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii muscles, as well as on emotion recognition accuracy. These findings suggest that MOR activity is involved in automatic facial responses to fearful stimuli, but not in their identification. Overall, the current results, together with the previously reported small effects of opioid compounds, suggest a relatively marginal role of the MOR system in emotion simulation and perception.

Since the first publication of the optimal solution of the classic MABP by a dynamic index rule, the bandit literature quickly diversified and emerged as an active research topic. Across this literature, the use of bandit models to optimally design clinical trials became a typical motivating application, yet little of the resulting theory has ever been used in the actual design and analysis of clinical trials. To this end, we review two MABP decision-theoretic approaches to the optimal allocation of treatments in a clinical trial: the infinite-horizon Bayesian Bernoulli MABP and the finite-horizon variant. These models possess distinct theoretical properties and lead to separate allocation rules in a clinical trial design context. We evaluate their performance compared to other allocation rules, including fixed randomization. Our results indicate that bandit approaches offer significant advantages, in terms of assigning more patients to better treatments, and severe limitations, in terms of their resulting statistical power. We propose a novel bandit-based patient allocation rule that overcomes the issue of low power, thus removing a potential barrier for their use in practice.

We simulated and executed an adaptive allocation design to investigate the effects of a drug on male patients suffering from chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). This manuscript describes the clinical trial simulations and primary analysis results. A Bayesian adaptive allocation procedure was employed to allocate patients to treatment using a normal dynamic linear model. The study was to stop early for efficacy if the probability of a clinically significant difference between an experimental arm and placebo was at least 90%. The study was to stop for futility if the probability that the maximum effective dose was better than placebo by at least the futility difference was less than 20%. During the execution phase the study was stopped early, that is 32% less than planned maximum sample size, due to futility. The final results confirmed that the predefined stopping rules were met. In conclusion, the simulations showed that, if the drug was effective, this adaptive design could accomplish both the goals of PoC and DF.

This phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept, and dose-finding study adaptively randomized patients to receive ABT-089 (5, 10, 15, 20, 30, or 35 mg once daily) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, cognition subscale (ADAS-Cog) total score. A Bayesian response-adaptive randomization algorithm dynamically assigned allocation probabilities based on interim ADAS-Cog total scores. A normal dynamic linear model for dose-response relationships and a longitudinal model for predicting final ADAS-cog score were employed in the algorithm. Stopping criteria for futility or success were defined. The futility stopping criterion was met, terminating the study with 337 patients randomized. No dose-response relationship was observed and no dose demonstrated statistically significant improvement over placebo on ADAS-Cog or any secondary endpoint. ABT-089 was well tolerated at all dose levels. When administered as adjunctive therapy to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, ABT-089 was not efficacious in mild to moderate Alzheimer disease. The adaptive study design enabled the examination of a broad dose range, enabled rapid determination of futility, and reduced patient exposure to nonefficacious doses of the investigational compound.

A multivariate adaptive spline model is used to describe the functional predictors, and a generalized linear model with a random intercept describes the response. Through specifying the random intercept to follow a Dirichlet process jointly with the random spline coefficients, we obtain a procedure that clusters trajectories according to shape and according to the parameters of the response model for each cluster. This very flexible method allows for the incorporation of covariates in the models for both the response and the trajectory. We apply the method to post-ovulatory progesterone data from the Early Pregnancy Study and find that the model successfully predicts early pregnancy loss.

We redesigned a Bayesian adaptive design initially proposed for dose-finding, focusing our interest in the comparison of multiple experimental drugs to a control on a binary criterion measure. Methods: We redesigned a phase II clinical trial that randomly allocates patients across three (one control and two experimental) treatment arms to assess dropping decision rules. We were interested in dropping any arm due to futility, either based on historical control rate (first rule) or comparison across arms (second rule), and in stopping experimental arm due to its ability to reach a sufficient response rate (third rule), using the difference of response probabilities in Bayes binomial trials between the treated and control as a measure of treatment benefit. Simulations were then conducted to investigate the decision operating characteristics under a variety of plausible scenarios, as a function of the decision thresholds. Results: Our findings suggest that one experimental treatment was less efficient than the control and could have been dropped from the trial based on a sample of approximately 20 instead of 40 patients. In the simulation study, stopping decisions were reached sooner for the first rule than for the second rule, with close mean estimates of response rates and small bias. According to the decision threshold, the mean sample size to detect the required 0.15 absolute benefit ranged from 63 to 70 (rule 3) with false negative rates of less than 2 % (rule 1) up to 6 % (rule 2). In contrast, detecting a 0.15 inferiority in response rates required a sample size ranging on average from 23 to 35 (rules 1 and 2, respectively) with a false positive rate ranging from 3.6 to 0.6 % (rule 3). Conclusion: Adaptive trial design is a good way to improve clinical trials. It allows removing ineffective drugs and reducing the trial sample size, while maintaining unbiased estimates. Decision thresholds can be set according to predefined fixed error decision rates. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01342692 .

Therefore, before moving forward to a phase III confirmatory trial, the most effective dose is needed to be identified. Methods: The primary endpoint of a phase II trial is typically a binary endpoint of success or failure. The EMAX model, ubiquitous in pharmacology research, was fit for many compounds and described the data well, except for a single compound, which had nonmonotone dose-response (Thomas et al., Stat Biopharmaceutical Res. 6:302-317 2014). To mitigate the risk of nonmonotone dose response one of the alternative options is a Bayesian hierarchical EMAX model (Gajewski et al., Stat Med. 38:3123-3138 2019). The hierarchical EMAX adapts to its environment. Results: When the dose-response curve is monotonic it enjoys the efficiency of EMAX. When the dose-response curve is non-monotonic the additional random effect hyperprior makes the hierarchical EMAX model more adjustable and flexible. However, the normal dynamic linear model (NDLM) is a useful model to explore dose-response relationships in that the efficacy at the current dose depends on the efficacy of the previous dose(s). Previous research has compared the EMAX to the hierarchical EMAX (Gajewski et al., Stat Med. 38:3123-3138 2019) and the EMAX to the NDLM (Liu et al., BMC Med Res Method 17:149 2017), however, the hierarchical EMAX has not been directly compared to the NDLM. Conclusions: The focus of this paper is to compare these models and discuss the relative merit for each of their uses for an ongoing early phase dose selection study.

The Contact Lens Extended Wear Study (CLEWS) is a randomized, controlled clinical trial in which subjects are first adapted to full-time RGP daily wear prior to randomization to either high or medium oxygen transmissibility (Dk/L) RGP lenses for 12 months of extended wear. The CLEWS pre-randomization data provide an opportunity to examine the reasons some patients fail to adapt to RGP daily wear and to determine whether a patient's demographic, historical, and ocular characteristics can be used to predict RGP daily wear success. Methods: From 1,809 individuals who expressed interest in RGP lenses, 411 subjects passed the CLEWS screening criteria and were fit with high Dk lenses (mean Dk = 92 x 10(-11) [cm2/sec][mL 02/mL x mmHg]). The fitting strategy included minimum apical alignment, lid attachment, centration, and average lens diameters of 9.2 mm. Success was defined as a minimum of 14 hours per day without adverse ocular responses that would contraindicate either full-day daily wear or extended wear. Results: Of the 411 subjects, 286 (69.6%) were successful with RGP extended wear. Among the 125 failures, 50 were based on clinician findings (e.g., cornea, vision, compliance), while 75 subjects chose to discontinue wear because of unacceptable comfort or poor vision. Multivariate linear logistic regression modeling shows that younger patients with greater corneal curvature (K) and less predicted residual astigmatism have a higher probability of RGP daily wear success. Conclusions: Our study showed that RGP lenses can be fit with a relatively high rate of success and that many of those patients who elect to discontinue RGP daily wear report unacceptable comfort as the primary reason. We propose a Bayesian statistical method that will assist clinicians in selecting those candidates for RGP daily wear who are most likely to adapt successfully.",,Y,,,

One design used to address this challenge is the small n, sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (snSMART). We propose a new snSMART design that investigates the response rates of a drug tested at a low and high dose compared with placebo. Patients are randomized to an initial treatment (stage 1). In stage 2, patients are rerandomized, depending on their initial treatment and their response to that treatment in stage 1, to either the same or a different dose of treatment. Data from both stages are used to determine the efficacy of the active treatment. We present a Bayesian approach where information is borrowed between stage 1 and stage 2. We compare our approach to standard methods using only stage 1 data and a log-linear Poisson model that uses data from both stages where parameters are estimated using generalized estimating equations. We observe that the Bayesian method has smaller root-mean-square-error and 95% credible interval widths than standard methods in the tested scenarios. We conclude that it is advantageous to utilize data from both stages for a primary efficacy analysis and that the specific snSMART design shown here can be used in the registration of a drug for the treatment of rare diseases.

Intravenous (IV) ketamine is the most commonly used sedative agent for closed reductions. However, as children find IV insertion a distressing and painful procedure, there is need to identify a feasible alternative route of administration. There is evidence that a combination of dexmedetomidine and ketamine (ketodex), administered intranasally (IN), could provide adequate sedation for closed reductions while avoiding the need for IV insertion. However, there is uncertainty about the optimal combination dose for the two agents and whether it can provide adequate sedation for closed reductions. The Intranasal Dexmedetomidine Plus Ketamine for Procedural Sedation (Ketodex) study is a Bayesian phase II/III, non-inferiority trial in children undergoing PSA for closed reductions that aims to address both these research questions. This article presents in detail the statistical analysis plan for the Ketodex trial and was submitted before the outcomes of the trial were available for analysis. Methods/design: The Ketodex trial is a multicenter, four-armed, randomized, double-dummy controlled, Bayesian response adaptive dose finding, non-inferiority, phase II/III trial designed to determine (i) whether IN ketodex is non-inferior to IV ketamine for adequate sedation in children undergoing a closed reduction of a fracture or dislocation in a pediatric emergency department and (ii) the combination dose for IN ketodex that provides optimal sedation. Adequate sedation will be primarily measured using the Pediatric Sedation State Scale. As secondary outcomes, the Ketodex trial will compare the length of stay in the emergency department, time to wakening, and adverse events between study arms. Discussion: The Ketodex trial will provide evidence on the optimal dose for, and effectiveness of, IN ketodex as an alternative to IV ketamine providing sedation for patients undergoing a closed reduction. The data from the Ketodex trial will be analyzed from a Bayesian perspective according to this statistical analysis plan.

The study also included a dose-finding portion whose results are presented here. Methods: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients on metformin were randomized 3 : 1 : 1 to seven dulaglutide doses, sitagliptin (100 mg), or placebo. A Bayesian algorithm was used for randomization and dose selection. Patients were adaptively randomized to dulaglutide doses using available data on the basis of a clinical utility index (CUI) of glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) versus sitagliptin at 52 weeks and weight, pulse rate (PR) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) versus placebo at 26 weeks. The algorithm randomly assigned patients until two doses were selected. Results: Dulaglutide 1.5 mg was determined to be the optimal dose. Dulaglutide 0.75 mg met criteria for the second dose. Dulaglutide 1.5 mg showed the greatest Bayesian mean change from baseline (95% credible interval) in HbA1c versus sitagliptin at 52 weeks -0.63 (-0.98 to -0.20)%. Dulaglutide 2.0 mg showed the greatest placebo-adjusted mean change in weight [-1.99 (-2.88 to -1.20) kg] and in PR [0.78 (-2.10 to 3.80) bpm]. Dulaglutide 1.5 mg showed the greatest placebo-adjusted mean change in DBP [-0.62 (-3.40 to 2.30) mmHg].

Methods: To foster the development of dula, we designed a two-stage adaptive, dose-finding, inferentially seamless phase 2/3 study. The Bayesian theoretical framework is used to adaptively randomize patients in stage 1 to 7 dula doses and, at the decision point, to either stop for futility or to select up to 2 dula doses for stage 2. After dose selection, patients continue to be randomized to the selected dula doses or comparator arms. Data from patients assigned the selected doses will be pooled across both stages and analyzed with an analysis of covariance model, using baseline hemoglobin A1c and country as covariates. The operating characteristics of the trial were assessed by extensive simulation studies. Results: Simulations demonstrated that the adaptive design would identify the correct doses 88% of the time, compared to as low as 6% for a fixed-dose design (the latter value based on frequentist decision rules analogous to the Bayesian decision rules for adaptive design).

HCC was measured (N = 575) in 265 children using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Hair was sampled in Clinic Visits (CV) centered at years 1, 2, and 3 (n = 45); 1 and 2 (n = 98); 1 and 3 (n = 27); 2 and 3 (n = 95). Log-transformed HCC values were partitioned using latent class mixed models (LCMM) to minimize the Bayesian Information Criterion. Multivariable linear mixed effects models for ln-HCC as a function of fixed effects for age in months and random effects for participants (to account for repeated measures) were generated to identify the factors associated with class membership. Children in Class 1 (n = 69; 9% Black) evidenced declining ln-HCC across early childhood, whereas Class 2 members (n = 196; 43% Black) showed mixed trajectories. LCMM with only Class 2 members revealed Class 2A (n = 17, 82% Black) with sustained high ln-HCC and Class 2B (n = 179, 40% Blacks) with mixed ln-HCC profiles. Another LCMM limited to only Class 2B members revealed Class 2B1 (n = 65, 57% Black) with declining ln-HCC values (at higher ranges than Class 1), and Class 2B2 (n = 113, 30% Black) with sustained high ln-HCC values. Class 1 may represent hair cortisol trajectories associated with adaptive HPA-axis profiles, whereas 2A, 2B1, and 2B2 may represent allostatic load with dysregulated profiles of HPA-axis function in response to varying exposures to ELS. Sequential longitudinal hair cortisol measurements revealed the allostatic load associated with ELS and the potential for developing maladaptive or dysregulated HPA-axis function in early childhood.

The failure of many promising therapies during late-phase clinical trials prompted calls for alternative trial designs. We describe an innovative trial evaluating selepressin, a novel selective vasopressin V1a receptor agonist, for adults with septic shock. SEPSIS-ACT (Selepressin Evaluation Programme for Sepsis-induced Shock-Adaptive Clinical Trial) is a blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-part, adaptive phase 2b/3 trial, evaluating up to four selepressin dosing strategies. The primary outcome is pressor- and ventilator-free days, with a value of zero assigned for death within 30 days. We calculate Bayesian probabilities of final trial success to guide interim decision-making. Part 1 (dose-finding) has an adaptive sample size based on response-adaptive randomization and prespecified rules to determine stopping for futility or selection of the best dosing regimen for Part 2. Part 2 (confirmation) randomizes a minimum of 1,000 patients equally to the selected dosing regimen or placebo. The final estimate of treatment effect compares all selepressin-treated patients with all placebo-treated patients. The sample size of 1,800 provides 91% power to detect an increase of 1.5 pressor- and ventilator-free days with a reduction in mortality of 1.5%.

In contrast, we previously found that perceptual changes occurred in the opposite direction in response to tactile stimuli, conforming to bayesian integration theory (bayesian calibration). We further showed, in theory, that the effect of bayesian calibration cannot be observed when the lag adaptation was fully operational. This led to the hypothesis that bayesian calibration affects judgments regarding the order of audiovisual stimuli, but that this effect is concealed behind the lag adaptation mechanism. In the present study, we showed that lag adaptation is pitch-insensitive using two sounds at 1046 and 1480 Hz. This enabled us to cancel lag adaptation by associating one pitch with sound-first stimuli and the other with light-first stimuli. When we presented each type of stimulus (high- or low-tone) in a different block, the point of simultaneity shifted to ""sound-first"" for the pitch associated with sound-first stimuli, and to ""light-first"" for the pitch associated with light-first stimuli. These results are consistent with lag adaptation. In contrast, when we delivered each type of stimulus in a randomized order, the point of simultaneity shifted to ""light-first"" for the pitch associated with sound-first stimuli, and to ""sound-first"" for the pitch associated with light-first stimuli. The results clearly show that bayesian calibration is pitch-specific and is at work behind pitch-insensitive lag adaptation during temporal order judgment of audiovisual stimuli.",,Y,,,

However, pre-specified subgroup analysis is not always practical and post hoc analysis results should be examined cautiously. Bayesian hierarchical modelling provides grounds for defining a controlled post hoc analysis plan that is developed after seeing outcome data for the population but before unblinding the outcome by subgroup. Using simulation based on the results from a tobacco cessation clinical trial conducted among the general population, we defined an analysis plan to assess treatment effect among American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) enrolled in the study. Patients were randomized into two arms using Bayesian adaptive design. For the opt-in arm, clinicians offered a cessation treatment plan after verifying that a patient was ready to quit. For the opt-out arm, clinicians provided all participants with free cessation medications and referred them to a Quitline. The study was powered to test a hypothesis of significantly higher quit rates for the opt-out arm at one-month post randomization. Overall, one-month abstinence rates were 15.9% and 21.5% (opt-in and opt-out arm, respectively). For AI/AN, one-month abstinence rates were 10.2% and 22.0% (opt-in and opt-out arm, respectively).

Density dependence is a ubiquitous force that governs population dynamics and regulates population growth, yet its connections to the impacts of climate change remain little known, especially in marine studies. Reductions in density below an environmental carrying capacity may cause compensatory increases in demographic parameters and population growth rate, hence masking the impacts of climate change on populations. On the other hand, climate-driven deterioration of conditions may reduce environmental carrying capacities, making compensation less likely and populations more susceptible to the effects of stochastic processes. Here we investigate the effects of climate change on Baltic blue mussels using a 17-year dataset on population density. Using a Bayesian modelling framework, we investigate the impacts of climate change, assess the magnitude and effects of density dependence, and project the likelihood of population decline by the year 2030. Our findings show negative impacts of warmer and less saline waters, both outcomes of climate change. We also show that density dependence increases the likelihood of population decline by subjecting the population to the detrimental effects of stochastic processes (i.e. low densities where random bad years can cause local extinction, negating the possibility for random good years to offset bad years). We highlight the importance of understanding, and accounting for both density dependence and climate variation when predicting the impact of climate change on keystone species, such as the Baltic blue mussel.

While most MDR/RR-TB patients do not receive treatment, many who do are treated for 18 months or more. A shorter all-oral regimen is currently recommended for only a sub-set of MDR/RR-TB. Its use is only conditionally recommended because of very low-quality evidence underpinning the recommendation. Novel combinations of newer and repurposed drugs bring hope in the fight against MDR/RR-TB, but their use has not been optimized in all-oral, shorter regimens. This has greatly limited their impact on the burden of disease. There is, therefore, dire need for high-quality evidence on the performance of new, shortened, injectable-sparing regimens for MDR-TB which can be adapted to individual patients and different settings. Methods: endTB is a phase III, pragmatic, multi-country, adaptive, randomized, controlled, parallel, open-label clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of shorter treatment regimens containing new drugs for patients with fluoroquinolone-susceptible, rifampin-resistant tuberculosis. Study participants are randomized to either the control arm, based on the current standard of care for MDR/RR-TB, or to one of five 39-week multi-drug regimens containing newly approved and repurposed drugs. Study participation in all arms lasts at least 73 and up to 104 weeks post-randomization. Randomization is response-adapted using interim Bayesian analysis of efficacy endpoints. The primary objective is to assess whether the efficacy of experimental regimens at 73 weeks is non-inferior to that of the control. A sample size of 750 patients across 6 arms affords at least 80% power to detect the non-inferiority of at least 1 (and up to 3) experimental regimens, with a one-sided alpha of 0.025 and a non-inferiority margin of 12%, against the control in both modified intention-to-treat and per protocol populations. Discussion: The lack of a safe and effective regimen that can be used in all patients is a major obstacle to delivering appropriate treatment to all patients with active MDR/RR-TB. Identifying multiple shorter, safe, and effective regimens has the potential to greatly reduce the burden of this deadly disease worldwide.

However, few neuropsychological studies investigated the role of brain regions in the left frontal cortex and some previous evidence from bilateral studies remained inconclusive. This study presents a systematic investigation with high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD tDCS) in a focal 4 × 1 configuration, which was used to target the left IFG or the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with 1-mA active or sham cathodal HD tDCS. Healthy participants were randomized into three groups. We analyzed performance in an adaptive stop-signal task to quantify inhibitory control before (baseline), during cathodal HD tDCS (on-line), and after cathodal HD tDCS (off-line) to either left IFG, left DLPFC, or sham. Results from 67 participants and Bayesian analyses indicated moderate evidence against an effect of cathodal tDCS (left DLPFC and left IFG compared with sham) regardless of timing, that is, on-line or off-line cathodal HD tDCS. The study results are examined in view of previous neuropsychological and neurostimulation studies with bilateral and unilateral cathodal tDCS in healthy and patient samples. Theoretically, our results are compatible with a right-lateralization of response inhibition functions and suggest a negligible role of the left frontal hemisphere in healthy participants, but more stimulation parameters can be still explored in the left hemisphere. In line with previous studies, right inferior frontal gyrus seems a more promising target to investigate or alleviate response inhibition with tDCS.",,Y,,,

The physiological stress of surgery in high-risk individuals has been proposed both as an important cause of accelerated age-related decline in health and as a model testing the effectiveness of strategies to improve resiliency to age-related health decline. We describe a randomised, embedded, multifactorial, adaptative platform (REMAP) trial to investigate multiple perioperative interventions, the first of which is metformin and selected for its anti-inflammatory and anti-ageing properties beyond its traditional blood glucose control features. Methods and analysis: Within a multihospital, single healthcare system, the Core Protocol for Strategies to Promote ResiliencY (SPRY) will be embedded within both the electronic health record (EHR) and the healthcare culture generating a continuously self-learning healthcare system. Embedding reduces the administrative burden of a traditional trial while accessing and rapidly analysing routine patient care EHR data. SPRY-Metformin is a placebo-controlled trial and is the first SPRY domain evaluating the effectiveness of three metformin dosages across three preoperative durations within a heterogeneous set of major surgical procedures. The primary outcome is 90-day hospital-free days. Bayesian posterior probabilities guide interim decision-making with predefined rules to determine stopping for futility or superior dosing selection. Using response adaptative randomisation, a maximum of 2500 patients allows 77%-92% power, detecting >15% primary outcome improvement. Secondary outcomes include mortality, readmission and postoperative complications. A subset of patients will be selected for substudies evaluating the microbiome, cognition, postoperative delirium and strength.

The aim of the INFORM (INdividualized Therapy FOr Relapsed Malignancies in Childhood) program is to translate next generation molecular diagnostics into a biomarker driven treatment strategy. The program consists of two major foundations: the INFORM registry providing a molecular screening platform and the INFORM2 series of biomarker driven phase I/II trials. The INFORM2 NivEnt trial aims to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination treatment of nivolumab and entinostat (phase I) and to evaluate activity and safety (phase II). Methods: This is an exploratory non-randomized, open-label, multinational and multicenter seamless phase I/II trial in children and adolescents with relapsed / refractory or progressive high-risk solid tumors and CNS tumors. The phase I is divided in 2 age cohorts: 12-21 years and 6-11 years and follows a 3 + 3 design with two dose levels for entinostat (2 mg/m2 and 4 mg/m2 once per week) and fixed dose nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Patients entering the trial on RP2D can seamlessly enter phase II which consists of a biomarker defined four group basket trial: high mutational load (group A), high PD-L1 mRNA expression (group B), focal MYC(N) amplification (group C), low mutational load and low PD-L1 mRNA expression and no MYC(N) amplification (group D). A Bayesian adaptive design will be used to early stop cohorts that fail to show evidence of activity. The maximum number of patients is 128. Discussion: This trial intends to exploit the immune enhancing effects of entinostat on nivolumab using an innovative biomarker driven approach in order to maximize the chance of detecting signs of activity. It prevents exposure to unnecessary risks by applying the Bayesian adaptive design for early stopping for futility. The adaptive biomarker driven design provides an innovative approach accelerating drug development and reducing exposure to investigational treatments in these vulnerable children at the same time.

246,"Dominique Martinez, Eduardo Martin Moraud",,Reactive and Cognitive Search Strategies for Olfactory Robots,26042328,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26042328,"Excerpt Tracking scents and odor sources is a major challenge in robotics, with applications to the localization of chemical leaks, drugs, and explosives (Russell 1999). Nowadays, animals are commonly used in safety and security tasks because of their excellent smell detection capabilities. Examples include dogs and honeybees (Rains et al. 2008). However, using animals to sniff specific odors related to bombs or explosives has several drawbacks. On top of the hazards of such endeavors, animals like dogs show behavioral variations and changing moods. They get tired after extensive work and require frequent retraining as their performance decreases over time. As an alternative, could we envision using olfactory robots to advantageously replace animals for these tasks? At short distances from the source, olfactory search methods inspired by bacterial chemotaxis provide acceptable solutions for navigating a robot. Bacteria like Escherichia coli direct toward chemo-attractants by climbing a concentration gradient. They alternate between periods of straight swims called runs and random reorientations called tumbles (Berg 2003). Such biased random walks have been implemented on real robots (Lytridis et al. 2006; Russell et al. 2003; Marques et al. 2006), yet with a limited success, mainly because of the use of a single odor sensor. Unlike bacteria, other animals may use instantaneous gradient information assessed by comparing the responses of spatially separated chemosensors. This claim is supported by experiments showing that unilateral lesions, like the blockage of the nasal airflow in one nostril in rats or the ablation of one of the antennae in crayfish, impair odor source localization (Kraus-Epley and Moore 2002; Rajan et al. 2006; McMahon et al. 2005). Autonomous olfactory robots using bilateral comparison include the robotic “lobster” for tracking saline plumes in water (Consi et al. 1995; Grasso et al. 1997; Grasso 2001), the Braitenberg olfactory robot (Lilienthal and Duckett 2003), and our robot (Hugues et al. 2003; Martinez et al. 2006), whose trajectory curvature was constantly modulated by the difference in concentration between left and right sensors (Figure 5.1a). A prerequisite to all the aforementioned chemotactic robots is the existence of a relatively smooth concentration gradient. The experiments we performed revealed that a concentration gradient can effectively be measured (see Figure 5.4 , left in Martinez et al. 2006), but only when the robot moves slowly (2.5 cm/s) and near to the source (search area limited to 3 m2). As chemotactic search strategies are applicable only in the vicinity of the source, we considered the possibility of exploring the environment by using vision, in addition to olfaction (Martinez and Perrinet 2002). An important limitation nevertheless is that odor source candidates need to be identifiable from visual features. Far from the source, the concentration landscape of an odor, called a plume, is very heterogeneous and unsteady, and consists of sporadically located patches (Weissburg 2000; Roberts and Webster 2002). Even at moderate distances (order 10 m), detections become sporadic and only provide cues intermittently. Given this discontinuous flow of information, how then can we efficiently navigate a robot toward the source over moderate or large distances (order 100 m)? It is well known that insects such as male moths successfully locate their mates over distances of hundreds of meters. To do so, male moths adopt a typical behavior (for reviews see, e.g., Murlis et al. 1992; Kaissling 1997; Vickers 2006). Upon sensing a pheromone patch, they surge upwind, and when the odor information vanishes, they perform an extended crosswind casting until the plume is reacquired. This strategy has the advantage of being purely reactive; i.e., actions are completely determined by current perceptions, that is, surge upwind upon sensing a pheromone patch and cast crosswind when odor information vanishes. Such reactive methods have been simulated or implemented on robots in various forms (Kuwana et al. 1999; Pyk et al. 2006; Balkovsky and Shraiman 2002). An efficient variant is the spiral-surge strategy (Hayes et al. 2002; Lochmatter et al. 2008) that combines upwind surge in the presence of the odor with spiraling in its absence (Figure 5.1b). Yet performance of reactive strategies at distances beyond 100 m, when the reacquisition of the plume becomes very unlikely, is unclear. Reactive casting-surge methods address the search problem only from an imitation perspective; i.e., they mimic the choices performed by animals through a rule-based approach, regardless of the underlying mechanisms from which the behavior emerges. This biomimetic approach raises the question of how well reactive strategies may be adapted to new environmental conditions as those occurring when the distance from the source increases. For those conditions, a more sophisticated method, infotaxis, was proposed recently (Vergassola et al. 2007; Martinez 2007). Infotaxis relies on Bayesian inference to maximize information gain, and exploits the expected distribution of odor encounters. It involves a period of exploration during which the searcher builds a probabilistic map of the source location. As the searcher accumulates information, the map becomes sharper and its entropy—which reflects the uncertainty about the location of the source—decreases. Because the expected search time is determined by the uncertainty of the belief, the searcher moves so as to maximize the expected reduction in entropy, and therefore the rate of information acquisition. Maximizing information gain entails a competition between two actions, exploitation and exploration. The former drives the searcher toward locations where the probability of finding the source is high. The latter favors motion to regions with lower probabilities of source discovery but high rewards in terms of information gain. Infotaxis is a cognitive strategy in the sense that an internal model of the world is built from past detections and actions so that memory and learning play a crucial role (Figure 5.1c). Advantages, disadvantages, limitations, and biological plausibility of cognitive and reactive search strategies are largely unknown and remain to be quantified. In this chapter, we review the two approaches and report comparisons based on simulations and robotic experiments. To our knowledge, only two studies have considered a robotic implementation of infotaxis: Lochmatter (2010) and Moraud and Martinez (2010).",,Y,,,

More than 380,000 patients suffer out-of-hospital cardiac arrest annually in the United States. Induced cooling of comatose patients markedly improved neurological and functional outcomes in pivotal randomized clinical trials, but the optimal duration of therapeutic hypothermia has not yet been established. Methods: This study is a multi-center randomized, response-adaptive, duration (dose) finding, comparative effectiveness clinical trial with blinded outcome assessment. We investigate two populations of adult comatose survivors of cardiac arrest to ascertain the shortest duration of cooling that provides the maximum treatment effect. The design is based on a statistical model of response as defined by the primary endpoint, a weighted 90-day mRS (modified Rankin Scale, a measure of neurologic disability), across the treatment arms. Subjects will initially be equally randomized between 12, 24, and 48 hours of therapeutic cooling. After the first 200 subjects have been randomized, additional treatment arms between 12 and 48 hours will be opened and patients will be allocated, within each initial cardiac rhythm type (shockable or non-shockable), by response adaptive randomization. As the trial continues, shorter and longer duration arms may be opened. A maximum sample size of 1800 subjects is proposed. Secondary objectives are to characterize: the overall safety and adverse events associated with duration of cooling, the effect on neuropsychological outcomes, and the effect on patient reported quality of life measures. Discussion: In-vitro and in-vivo studies have shown the neuroprotective effects of therapeutic hypothermia for cardiac arrest. We hypothesize that longer durations of cooling may improve either the proportion of patients that attain a good neurological recovery or may result in better recovery among the proportion already categorized as having a good outcome. If the treatment effect of cooling is increasing across duration, for at least some set of durations, then this provides evidence of the efficacy of cooling itself versus normothermia, even in the absence of a normothermia control arm, confirming previous RCTs for OHCA survivors of shockable rhythms and provides the first prospective controlled evidence of efficacy in those without initial shockable rhythms.

These client statements, in turn, have been shown to predict intervention outcomes. The current study examines sequential associations between therapist behaviors and client change and sustain talk in a sample of Latinx individuals who engage in heavy alcohol consumption. Data: Data are from a completed randomized clinical trial of a culturally adapted (CAMI) versus unadapted MI targeting alcohol use and consequences among Latinx individuals. Method: The study collected observational coding data with the Motivational Interviewing Skill Code (MISC 2.5, i.e., therapist behaviors and global ratings) and the Client Language Assessment - Proximal/Distal (CLA-PD, i.e., client language). Frequentist and Bayesian sequential analyses examined the relationship among nine different categories of therapist behaviors and three different categories of client language (i.e., change talk, sustain talk, neutral). We examined odds ratios and conditional probabilities for the direction, magnitude, and significance of the association between the use of MI technical behaviors and subsequent client statements about change. The study compared these same transitional associations between low/average (i.e., <4) and high (i.e., ?4) MI Spirit sessions. Results: The pattern of results was replicated across both analytic frameworks. Questions and reflections about change talk versus sustain talk versus neutral statements showed greater odds of predicting the intended client response (i.e., change talk, sustain talk, neutral, respectively) compared to other possible client responses. Conditional probabilities for these transitions were high, ranging from 0.55 to.88. The magnitude of certain technical transitions significantly differed between low/average and high MI Spirit sessions. Conclusions: Analyses supported the hypothesized associations between therapist use of technical MI behaviors and client change language within this Latinx sample. Analyses of MI Spirit as a moderator of these transitions showed partial support. Keywords: Dyadic interactions; Health disparities; Latinx; Process research.",,Y,,,

This is highly toxic, particularly for patients > 60 years, potentially leading to prolonged hospitalisations requiring intensive supportive care, and sometimes treatment-related death. This also results in extensive healthcare costs and negatively impacts quality of life (QoL). Venetoclax with low-dose cytarabine (VEN + LDAC) is a novel, low-intensity treatment for AML patients who cannot receive IC. VEN + LDAC is given as an outpatient and toxicity appears significantly lower than with IC. Analysis of clinical trials performed to date are promising for patients with the genotype NPM1mutFLT3 ITDneg, where remission and survival rates appear comparable to those achieved with IC. Methods: VICTOR is an international, two-arm, open-label, multi-centre, non-inferiority, randomised-controlled phase II trial to assess VEN + LDAC compared to standard of care (IC) as first-line treatment in older patients (initially aged ? 60 years) with newly diagnosed AML. The trial will recruit patients with a NPM1mutFLT3 ITDneg genotype; those with a favourable risk in relation to the experimental treatment. University of Birmingham is the UK co-ordinating centre, with national hubs in Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark, and Auckland District Health Board, New Zealand. The primary outcome is molecular event-free survival time where an event is defined as failure to achieve morphological complete response (CR) or CR with incomplete blood count recovery after two cycles of therapy; molecular persistence, progression or relapse requiring treatment change; morphological relapse, or; death. Secondary outcomes include cumulative resource use at 12- and 24-months, and QoL as assessed by EORTCQLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-3L at 3-, 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-months. The trial employs an innovative Bayesian design with target sample size of 156 patients aged > 60 years. Discussion: The principle underpinning the VICTOR trial is that the chance of cure for patients in the experimental arm should not be compromised, therefore, an adaptive design with regular checks on accumulating data has been employed, which will allow for a staged expansion of the trial population to include younger patients if, and when, there is sufficient evidence of non-inferiority in older patients.

We propose a design that accumulates information on subjects with regard to both dose-limiting toxicity and response conditional on no dose-limiting toxicity. Bayesian methods are used to update the estimates of dose-limiting toxicity and response probabilities when each subject is enrolled, and we use these methods to determine the dose level assigned to each subject. Due to the need to explore doses more fully, each subject is not necessarily assigned the current estimate of the most successful dose; our algorithm may instead assign a dose that is in a neighborhood of the current most successful dose. We examine the ability of our design to correctly identify the most successful dose in a variety of settings via simulation and compare the performance of our design to that of competing approaches.

Preclinical and single-arm trials have suggested that adding histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors may synergize the epigenetic modulation of hypomethylating agents and improve treatment results. Methods: The objective of this study was to evaluate the possible benefit of adding valproic acid, an HDAC inhibitor, to decitabine in the treatment of MDS and AML. Results: Patients with higher risk MDS or with AML aged ?60 years were eligible. Patients were randomized in a Bayesian response-adaptive design to receive intravenous decitabine 20 mg/m(2) daily for 5 days or decitabine plus oral valproic acid 50 mg/kg daily for 7 days. Courses were repeated every 4 to 6 weeks. A maximum of 150 patients were to be treated. In total, 149 patients were treated on study, including 87 patients with MDS and 62 patients with AML. The median patient age was 69 years (range, 20-89 years; 42% of patients were aged ?70 years). Overall, 34% of patients achieved complete remission, and 55% had an objective response. The median survival was 11.9 months, and the estimated 2-year survival rate was 27%. Outcome was not different with the addition of valproic acid to decitabine versus decitabine alone in relation to the rates of complete remission, overall response, or survival. Subset analyses did not demonstrate a benefit within the MDS or AML categories. Toxicities-particularly neurotoxicities-were higher with the combination arm. Conclusions: Adding valproic acid to decitabine was not associated with improved outcome in the treatment of patients with MDS or elderly patients with AML. Future therapies may consider combining hypomethylating agents with better HDAC inhibitors and using different schedules.

Methods Leveraging a combined sample of 3,868 autistic youth drawn from 12 distinct data sources (ages 3-18 years and representing the full range of cognitive ability), the current study used modern psychometric and meta-analytic techniques to interrogate the latent structure and correlates of caregiver-reported HYPER, HYPO, and SEEK within and across sensory modalities. Bifactor statistical indices were used to both evaluate the strength of a ""general response pattern"" factor for each supra-modal construct and determine the added value of ""modality-specific response pattern"" scores (e.g., Visual HYPER). Bayesian random-effects integrative data analysis models were used to examine the clinical and demographic correlates of all interpretable HYPER, HYPO and SEEK (sub)constructs. Results All modality-specific HYPER subconstructs could be reliably and validly measured, whereas certain modality-specific HYPO and SEEK subconstructs were psychometrically inadequate when measured using existing items. Bifactor analyses unambiguously supported the validity of a supra-modal HYPER construct (? H = .800), whereas a coherent supra-modal HYPO construct was not supported (? H = .611), and supra-modal SEEK models suggested a more limited version of the construct that excluded some sensory modalities (? H = .799; 4/7 modalities). Within each sensory construct, modality-specific subscales demonstrated substantial added value beyond the supra-modal score. Meta-analytic correlations varied by construct, although sensory features tended to correlate most strongly with other domains of core autism features and co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. Certain subconstructs within the HYPO and SEEK domains were also associated with lower adaptive behavior scores. Limitations: Conclusions may not be generalizable beyond the specific pool of items used in the current study, which was limited to parent-report of observable behaviors and excluded multisensory items that reflect many ""real-world"" sensory experiences. Conclusion Psychometric issues may limit the degree to which some measures of supra-modal HYPO/SEEK can be interpreted.

A case study on the TORCH trial,29298639,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29298639,"Abstract Count outcomes occur in virtually all disciplines, such as medicine, epidemiology or biology, but they often contain error. Recently, it has been shown that self-reported numbers of exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease patients can be considerably miscounted. Motivated by this result, we reanalysed data from the Towards a Revolution in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Health trial, a large randomized controlled trial with the self-reported number of exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease patients as outcome. To adjust for miscounting error in the response of Poisson and (zero-inflated) negative binomial models, we introduce novel, general methodology. The key idea is to formulate a zero-inflated negative binomial model to capture the error mechanism. This parametric approach automatically circumvents drawbacks of previously suggested methodology that treats miscounted outcomes in the misclassification framework. Prior information for the response error model parameters was elicited from validation data of an external study and adaptively weighted to account for potential prior-data conflict. The results of the Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach indicated that the treatment effect has been overestimated in the original study. However, closer inspection revealed that this unexpected result was an artefact of an unaccounted time dependency of the treatment effect.

However, little is known about the genetic foundation underlying salinity tolerance at the seedling growth stage of wheat. Herein, a GWAS analysis was carried out by the random-SNP-effect mixed linear model (mrMLM) multi-locus model to uncover candidate genes responsible for salt tolerance at the seedling stage in 298 Iranian bread wheat accessions, including 208 landraces and 90 cultivars. Results: A total of 29 functional marker-trait associations (MTAs) were detected under salinity, 100 mM NaCl (sodium chloride). Of these, seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including rs54146, rs257, rs37983, rs18682, rs55629, rs15183, and rs63185 with R2 ? 10% were found to be linked with relative water content, root fresh weight, root dry weight, root volume, shoot high, proline, and shoot potassium (K+), respectively. Further, a total of 27 candidate genes were functionally annotated to be involved in response to the saline environment. Most of these genes have key roles in photosynthesis, response to abscisic acid, cell redox homeostasis, sucrose and carbohydrate metabolism, ubiquitination, transmembrane transport, chromatin silencing, and some genes harbored unknown functions that all together may respond to salinity as a complex network. For genomic prediction (GP), the genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) model reflected genetic effects better than both bayesian ridge regression (BRR) and ridge regression-best linear unbiased prediction (RRBLUP), suggesting GBLUP as a favorable tool for wheat genomic selection. Conclusion: The SNPs and candidate genes identified in the current work can be used potentially for developing salt-tolerant varieties at the seedling growth stage by marker-assisted selection.

We develop a new clinical trial design to address some of these issues. The goal is to capture the strengths of the frequentist and Bayesian approaches to address this problem in the recent literature and to circumvent their limitations. Methods: We use generalized likelihood ratio tests of the intersection null and enriched strategy null hypotheses to derive a novel clinical trial design for the problem of advancing promising biomarker-guided strategies toward eventual validation. We also investigate the usefulness of adaptive randomization (AR) and futility stopping proposed in the recent literature. Results: Simulation studies demonstrate the advantages of testing both the narrowly focused enriched strategy null hypothesis related to validating a proposed strategy and the intersection null hypothesis that can accommodate to a potentially successful strategy. AR and early termination of ineffective treatments offer increased probability of receiving the preferred treatment and better response rates for patients in the trial, at the expense of more complicated inference under small-to-moderate total sample sizes and some reduction in power. Limitations: The binary response used in the development phase may not be a reliable indicator of treatment benefit on long-term clinical outcomes. In the proposed design, the biomarker-guided strategy (BGS) is not compared to 'standard of care', such as physician's choice that may be informed by patient characteristics. Therefore, a positive result does not imply superiority of the BGS to 'standard of care'. The proposed design and tests are valid asymptotically. Simulations are used to examine small-to-moderate sample properties. Conclusion: Innovative clinical trial designs are needed to address the difficulties and issues in the development and validation of biomarker-based personalized therapies.

For control to be effective, this study argues that the interactions between different geoenvironmental factors and gully erosion (as an indicator of land degradation) should be more fully investigated and spatially mapped. To do so, gully locations of the Konduran watershed, Iran, were detected in the field and modeled in response to seventeen geoenvironmental factors using three machine learning methods, i.e., multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), random forest (RF), regularized random forest (RRF), and Bayesian generalized linear model (Bayesian GLM). The models' performance was validated, the relationship of gully occurrence with each factor was quantified, the probability of gully erosion (i.e., land degradation) was retrospectively estimated, and the spatially explicit maps of land degradation susceptibility were produced. Based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the RRF and MARS models with AUC = 0.98 achieved the greatest goodness-of-fit with the training dataset, whereas the RF model with AUC = 0.83 showed the greatest ability in predicting future gully occurrences. Further scrutinization using the sensitivity and specificity metrics demonstrated the efficiency of the RF model for correctly classifying the gully (sensitivity-training = 92%; sensitivity-validation = 90%) and non-gully (specificity-training = 95%; specificity-validation = 68%) pixels. Nearly 13% of the study area ended up being the hardest hit region due to their general characteristics of distance from roads and rives, altitude, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) that were identified as the most influential factors in gully erosion occurrence. Given the resolution quality and reliable predictive accuracy, our spatially explicit maps of land susceptibility to gully erosion can be used by authorities and urban planners for identifying the target areas for rehabilitation and making more informed decisions for infrastructure development. Although our study was strictly focused on a certain region, our recommendations and implications are of global significance.

According to predictive coding theory, detecting these irregularities relies both on incoming sensory information and our top-down prior expectations (or internal generative models) about the world. Prediction errors (PEs), detectable in event-related potentials (ERPs), occur when there is a mismatch between the sensory input and our internal model (i.e., a surprise event). Many changes occurring in our environment are irrelevant for survival and may remain unseen. Such changes, even if subtle, can nevertheless be detected by the brain without emerging into consciousness. What remains unclear is how these changes are processed in the brain at the network level. Here, we used a visual oddball paradigm in which participants engaged in a central letter task during electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings while presented with task-irrelevant high- or low-coherence background, random-dot motion. Critically, once in a while, the direction of the dots changed. After the EEG session, we confirmed that changes in motion direction at high- and low-coherence were visible and invisible, respectively, using psychophysical measurements. ERP analyses revealed that changes in motion direction elicited PE regardless of the visibility, but with distinct spatiotemporal patterns. To understand these responses, we applied dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to the EEG data. Bayesian Model Averaging showed visible PE relied on a release from adaptation (repetition suppression) within bilateral MT+, whereas invisible PE relied on adaptation at bilateral V1 (and left MT+). Furthermore, while feedforward upregulation was present for invisible PE, the visible change PE also included downregulation of feedback between right MT+ to V1. Our findings reveal a complex interplay of modulation in the generative network models underlying visible and invisible motion changes.

Mental health needs, substance use problems, and issues unique to homelessness such as lack of shelter and transiency need to be considered with regard to HIV prevention. To date, HIV prevention interventions for young adults experiencing homelessness have not specifically addressed modifiable real-time factors such as stress, sexual or drug use urge, or substance use, or been delivered at the time of heightened risk. Real-time, personalized HIV prevention messages may reduce HIV risk behaviors. Objective: This pilot study tested the initial efficacy of an innovative, smartphone-based, just-in-time adaptive intervention that assessed predictors of HIV risk behaviors in real time and automatically provided behavioral feedback and goal attainment information. Methods: A randomized attention control design was used among young adults experiencing homelessness, aged 18-25 years, recruited from shelters and drop-in centers in May 2019. Participants were randomized to either a control or an intervention group. The intervention (called MY-RID [Motivating Youth to Reduce Infection and Disconnection]) consisted of brief messages delivered via smartphone over 6 weeks in response to preidentified predictors that were assessed using ecological momentary assessments. Bayesian hierarchical regression models were used to assess intervention effects on sexual activity, drug use, alcohol use, and their corresponding urges. Results: Participants (N=97) were predominantly youth (mean age 21.2, SD 2.1 years) who identified as heterosexual (n=51, 52%), male (n=56, 57%), and African American (n=56, 57%). Reports of sexual activity, drug use, alcohol use, stress, and all urges (ie, sexual, drug, alcohol) reduced over time in both groups. Daily drug use reduced by a factor of 13.8 times over 6 weeks in the intervention group relative to the control group (Multimedia Appendix 4). Lower urges for sex were found in the intervention group relative to the control group over the duration of the study. Finally, there was a statistically significant reduction in reports of feeling stressed the day before between the intervention and control conditions (P=.03). Conclusions: Findings indicate promising intervention effects on drug use, stress, and urges for sex in a hard-to-reach, high-risk population. The MY-RID intervention should be further tested in a larger randomized controlled trial to further investigate its efficacy and impact on sexual risk behaviors.

Studies in non-human primates have shown that modest levels of noradrenaline improve working memory, and that higher levels of noradrenaline impair working memory performance. However, research in humans provided inconsistent findings concerning noradrenergic effects on working memory. Objective: The present study aimed at assessing dose-dependent effects of yohimbine, an alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, on working memory performance in healthy humans. We further aimed to explore a potential interactive effect between noradrenergic arousal and lack of control over aversive events on working memory performance. Methods: We used a double-blind, fully crossed, placebo-controlled, between-subject design. Participants (N = 121) performed an adaptive n-back task before and after oral administration of either a placebo, 20 mg, or 40 mg yohimbine and a manipulation of controllability, during which participants could either learn to avoid electric shocks (controllability groups), had no instrumental control over shock administration (uncontrollability groups), or did not receive any shocks (no-shock control group). Results: While no significant results of noradrenergic stimulation through yohimbine were obtained using conventional frequentist analyses, additional Bayesian analyses provided strong evidence for the absence of an association between pharmacological treatment and working memory performance. We further observed no effect of controllability and no interaction between noradrenergic stimulation and the manipulation of controllability. Conclusions: Our results suggest that noradrenergic stimulation through yohimbine does not affect (non-spatial) working memory in healthy human participants.

While many natural systems have adapted to attenuate or even usefully integrate noise, the variability it introduces often still delimits the achievable precision across biological functions. This is particularly so for visual phototransduction, the process responsible for converting photons of light into usable electrical signals (quantum bumps). Here, randomness of both the photon inputs (regarded as extrinsic noise) and the conversion process (intrinsic noise) are seen as two distinct, independent and significant limitations on visual reliability. Past research has attempted to quantify the relative effects of these noise sources by using approximate methods that do not fully account for the discrete, point process and time ordered nature of the problem. As a result the conclusions drawn from these different approaches have led to inconsistent expositions of phototransduction noise performance. This paper provides a fresh and complete analysis of the relative impact of intrinsic and extrinsic noise in invertebrate phototransduction using minimum mean squared error reconstruction techniques based on Bayesian point process (Snyder) filters. An integrate-fire based algorithm is developed to reliably estimate photon times from quantum bumps and Snyder filters are then used to causally estimate random light intensities both at the front and back end of the phototransduction cascade. Comparison of these estimates reveals that the dominant noise source transitions from extrinsic to intrinsic as light intensity increases. By extending the filtering techniques to account for delays, it is further found that among the intrinsic noise components, which include bump latency (mean delay and jitter) and shape (amplitude and width) variance, it is the mean delay that is critical to noise performance. As the timeliness of visual information is important for real-time action, this delay could potentially limit the speed at which invertebrates can respond to stimuli. Consequently, if one wants to increase visual fidelity, reducing the photoconversion lag is much more important than improving the regularity of the electrical signal.",,Y,,,

We performed a randomized phase 2 study comparing HD-R versus standard-dose rituximab (SD-R) in R-NHL. Ninety-three patients were randomized to HD-R (1000 mg/m2 ) (n = 42) or SD-R (375 mg/m2 ) (n = 51) administered on post-transplant days +1 and +8, using a Bayesian adaptive algorithm. The 2 treatment arms were balanced in regards to patient demographic and clinical characteristics. At a median follow-up of 7·92 years, the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 40% and 48%, respectively. We found no statistically significant differences between HD-R and SD-R in 5-year DFS (36% vs. 43%; P = 0·205) and OS (43% vs. 52%; P = 0·392). In multivariate analyses, only disease status before ASCT [residual disease versus complete remission (CR)] (hazard ratio [HR] 1·79, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1·08-2·95) and number of prior treatments received (>2 vs. ?2 lines of treatment) (HR 1·89, 95% CI: 1·13-3·18) were associated with worse DFS and OS.

No differences in engraftments or adverse events were noted in the 2 arms. When combined with BEAM and ASCT in relapsed aggressive B-cell NHL, HD-R provided no DFS or OS advantage over SD-R.

The design employed allowed a continuous reassessment of the estimated dose-response such that patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to one of seven doses of the investigational drug, placebo, or active comparator. The study design also permitted early detection of futility allowing for early study termination. By using the adaptive trial design approach, only 202 patients were needed to make the determination of futility. In contrast, a conventional design would have required enrollment of 450 patients and considerably more time and expense to reach the same conclusion. Adaptive trial designs are important at this time when many pharmaceutical companies are abandoning the development of psychiatric medications because of the inefficiency of conventional approaches.

Yet it can help formulating evolutionary hypotheses regarding local adaptation and future responses to changing environments. Key issues include statistical selection of a demographic and historical scenario among a set of possible scenarios, and estimation of the parameter(s) of interest under the chosen scenario. Such inferences greatly benefit from (a) independent information on evolutionary rate and pattern at genetic markers; and (b) new statistical approaches, such as approximate Bayesian computation-random forest (ABC-RF), which provides reliable inference at a low computational cost and the possibility to measure prediction quality at the exact position of the observed data set. Here, we show full potential of the ABC-RF approach including prior knowledge on microsatellite genetic markers to decipher the evolutionary history of the African arid-adapted pest locust, Schistocerca gregaria, with support for a southern colonization of Africa, from a low number of founders of northern origin, dating back 2.6 Ky (90% CI: 0.9-6.6 Ky). We verify that this divergence time estimate accurately reflected true divergence time values by computing accuracy at a local posterior scale from simulated pseudo-observed data sets. The inferred divergence history is better explained by the peculiar biology of S. gregaria, which involves a density-dependent swarming phase with some exceptional spectacular migrations, rather than a continuous colonization resulting from the continental expansion of open vegetation habitats during more ancient Quaternary glacial climatic episodes.

A limited number of transcriptomic studies have characterized the gene pathways involved in SLE in an attempt to identify the key pathogenic drivers of the disease. In order to further advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of SLE, we used a novel Bayesian network algorithm to hybridize knowledge- and data-driven methods, and then applied the algorithm to build an SLE gene network using transcriptomic data from 1,760 SLE patients' RNA from the two tabalumab Phase III trials (ILLUMINATE-I & -II), the largest SLE RNA dataset to date. Further, based on the gene network, we carried out hub- and key driver-gene analyses for gene prioritization. Our analyses identified that the JAK-STAT pathway genes, including JAK2, STAT1, and STAT2, played essential roles in SLE pathogenesis, and reaffirmed the recent discovery of pathogenic relevance of JAK-STAT signaling in SLE. Additionally, we showed that other genes, such as IRF1, IRF7, PDIA4, FAM72C, TNFSF10, DHX58, SIGLEC1, and PML, may be also important in SLE and serve as potential therapeutic targets for SLE. In summary, using a hybridized network construction approach, we systematically investigated gene-gene interactions based on their transcriptomic profiles, prioritized genes based on their importance in the network structure, and revealed new insights into SLE activity.

Phase I is based on toxicity to determine a ""maximum tolerable dose"" (MTD) of A, phase II is conducted to decide whether A at the MTD is promising in terms of response probability, and if so a large randomized phase III trial is conducted to compare A to a control treatment, C, usually based on survival time or progression free survival time. It is widely recognized that this paradigm has many flaws. A recent approach combines the first two phases by conducting a phase I-II trial, which chooses an optimal dose based on both efficacy and toxicity, and evaluation of A at the selected optimal phase I-II dose then is done in a phase III trial. This paper proposes a new design paradigm, motivated by the possibility that the optimal phase I-II dose may not maximize mean survival time with A. We propose a hybridized design, which we call phase I-II/III, that combines phase I-II and phase III by allowing the chosen optimal phase I-II dose of A to be re-optimized based on survival time data from phase I-II patients and the first portion of phase III. The phase I-II/III design uses adaptive randomization in phase I-II, and relies on a mixture model for the survival time distribution as a function of efficacy, toxicity, and dose. A simulation study is presented to evaluate the phase I-II/III design and compare it to the usual approach that does not re-optimize the dose of A in phase III.

In this work, we demonstrate the use of Bayesian Experimental Design (BED) in planning spatiotemporal surveillance of disease vectors. We frame survey planning as an optimization problem with the objective of identifying a calendar of sampling locations that maximizes the expected information regarding some goal. Here we consider the goals of understanding associations between environmental factors and tick presence and minimizing uncertainty in high risk areas. We illustrate our proposed BED workflow using an ongoing tick surveillance study in South Carolina parks. Following a model comparison study based on two years of initial data, several techniques for finding optimal surveys were compared to random sampling. Two optimization algorithms found surveys better than all replications of random sampling, while a space-filling heuristic performed favorably as well. Further, optimal surveys of just 20 visits were more effective than repeating the schedule of 111 visits used in 2021. We conclude that BED shows promise as a flexible and rigorous means of survey design for vector control, and could help alleviate pressure on local agencies by limiting the resources necessary for accurate information on arthropod distributions. We have made the code for our BED workflow publicly available on Zenodo to help promote the application of these methods to future surveillance efforts.

Response rates remain low, and mechanism-based dose optimization has not been reported. We investigated the clinical and pharmacodynamic results of different dose schedules of decitabine. Adults with advanced MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) were randomized to 1 of 3 decitabine schedules: (1) 20 mg/m2 intravenously daily for 5 days; (2) 20 mg/m2 subcutaneously daily for 5 days; and (3) 10 mg/m2 intravenously daily for 10 days. Randomization followed a Bayesian adaptive design. Ninety-five patients were treated (77 with MDS, and 18 with CMML). Overall, 32 patients (34%) achieved a complete response (CR), and 69 (73%) had an objective response by the new modified International Working Group criteria. The 5-day intravenous schedule, which had the highest dose-intensity, was selected as optimal; the CR rate in that arm was 39%, compared with 21% in the 5-day subcutaneous arm and 24% in the 10-day intravenous arm (P < .05). The high dose-intensity arm was also superior at inducing hypomethylation at day 5 and at activating P15 expression at days 12 or 28 after therapy.

Methods: In this phase 2, 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study, patients with RA (N=158) on stable MTX were randomised by Bayesian-adaptive method to receive 1, 3, 10, 30, 60, or 120 mg tabalumab or placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. The primary objective was to test for a significant dose-response relationship using a statistical model of the proportion of patients having ?50% improvement in American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria (ACR50) at week 24 (prespecified ?=0.10). Results: At week 24, a significant dose-response relationship was observed using ACR50 (p=0.059) and ACR20 (p=0.044) response rates. Using model-estimated data, only 120 mg had significantly higher ACR50 and ACR20 response rates versus placebo (p<0.05). Observed response rates were significantly higher for 120 mg versus placebo as measured by ACR50 at weeks 12 (p=0.039) and 20 (p=0.018), but not week 24, and by ACR20 at weeks 12 (p=0.011) and 24 (p=0.039). Mean DAS28 C-reactive protein improved with 120 mg at week 24 (p=0.048). Frequency of TEAEs was similar across groups (range 50-69%, p=0.884). Ten (8.2%) tabalumab and 5 (13.9%) placebo patients reported a serious adverse event (SAE). Infections occurred more frequently in patients exposed to tabalumab (30.3% vs 19.4%). Serious infections were reported in 3 (2.5%) tabalumab-treated patients only. Conclusions: A dose-response relationship was detected with monthly subcutaneous tabalumab. A significant effect was detected with the 120 mg dose with no unexpected safety signals. CLINICAL TRIAL #: NCT00785928.

Despite using similar methods, a concurrent Swedish trial investigating the same question did not reach the same conclusion. The authors performed a simulation-based analysis to elucidate potential causes of these divergent results. Methods: The mean and standard deviation of the preoperative and 2-year postoperative Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores for each study group (laminectomy with fusion and laminectomy alone) were collected from the spondylolisthesis stratum of the Swedish trial and used to create a MATLAB simulator using linear transformations to predict postoperative ODI distributions. Applying this simulator to both varied and published preoperative ODI distributions from the SLIP trial, the authors simulated the results of the US-based trial using treatment effects from the Swedish study and compared simulated US results to those published in the SLIP trial. Results: Simulated US results showed that as preoperative disability increased, the difference in postoperative ODI scores grew between treatment groups and increasingly favored laminectomy alone (p < 0.0001). In 100 simulations of a similarly sized US trial, the average mean change in ODI scores postoperatively was significantly higher than was published for laminectomy alone in the SLIP trial (-21.3 vs -17.9), whereas it was significantly lower than published for fusion (-16.9 vs -26.3). Conclusions: The expected benefit of surgical treatments for spondylolisthesis varied according to preoperative disability. Adapting Swedish-estimated treatment effects to the US context mildly overapproximated the improvement in postoperative disability scores for laminectomy, but more severely underapproximated the improvement reported for laminectomy and fusion in the SLIP trial. The observed heterogeneity between these studies is influenced more by patient response to fusion than response to laminectomy. This analysis paves the way for future studies on the impact of preoperative treatment group heterogeneity, differences in surgical methods, and empirical design on reported clinical benefits. Although bayesian reanalysis of published randomized controlled trial data is susceptible to biases that typically limit post hoc analyses, the authors' method offers a simple and cost-effective approach to improve the understanding of published clinical trial results and their implications for future studies.

During a prespecified fixed follow-up period, the times to disease progression, toxicity, and death are monitored continuously, and an ordinal disease status variable, including progressive disease (PD) as one level, is evaluated repeatedly by scheduled imaging. We assume a proportional hazards model with piecewise constant baseline hazard for each continuous variable and a longitudinal multinomial probit model for the ordinal disease status process and include multivariate patient frailties to induce association among the outcomes. A finite partition of the nonfatal outcome combinations during the follow-up period is constructed, and the utility of each set in the partition is elicited. Posterior mean utility is used to optimize each patient's dose, subject to a safety rule excluding doses with an unacceptably high rate of PD, severe toxicity, or death. A simulation study shows that, compared with the proposed design, a simpler design based on commonly used efficacy and toxicity outcomes obtained by combining the four variables described above performs poorly and has substantially smaller probabilities of correctly choosing truly optimal doses and excluding truly unsafe doses.

When communities consist of discrete groups, shrinkage of estimates toward the community mean can mask differences among groups. Infinite-mixture models using a Dirichlet process (DP) distribution, in which the number of latent groups is estimated from the data, have been proposed as a solution. In addition to community structure, these models estimate species similarity, which allows testing hypotheses about whether traits drive species response to environmental conditions. We develop a community occupancy model (COM) using a DP distribution to model species-level parameters. Because clustering algorithms are sensitive to dimensionality and distinctiveness of clusters, we conducted a simulation study to explore performance of the DP-COM with different dimensions (i.e., different numbers of model parameters with species-level DP random effects) and under varying cluster differences. Because the DP-COM is computationally expensive, we compared its estimates to a COM with a normal random species effect. We further applied the DP-COM model to a bird data set from Uganda. Estimates of the number of clusters and species cluster identity improved with increasing difference among clusters and increasing dimensions of the DP; but the number of clusters was always overestimated. Estimates of number of sites occupied and species and community-level covariate coefficients on occupancy probability were generally unbiased with (near-) nominal 95% Bayesian Credible Interval coverage. Accuracy of estimates from the normal and the DP-COM was similar. The DP-COM clustered 166 bird species into 27 clusters regarding their affiliation with open or woodland habitat and distance to oil wells. Estimates of covariate coefficients were similar between a normal and the DP-COM. Except sunbirds, species within a family were not more similar in their response to these covariates than the overall community. Given that estimates were consistent between the normal and the DP-COM, and considering the computational burden for the DP models, we recommend using the DP-COM only when the analysis focuses on community structure and species similarity, as these quantities can only be obtained under the DP-COM.

Proactive dosing strategies to achieve and maintain predefined IFX trough levels (TL) may prevent LOR. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of dashboard driven IFX dosing compared to standard dosing in a prospective trial in IBD patients. Methods: In this multicentre 1:1 'PRECISION' trial, we randomized IBD patients in clinical remission (Harvey Bradshaw Index ?4 for Crohn's disease (CD) or a partial Mayo score ?2 for ulcerative colitis (UC)) receiving IFX maintenance treatment. The precision group (PG) received IFX dosing guided by a Bayesian pharmacokinetic model, aiming to achieve and maintain a TL of 3 µg/ml by treatment (de)escalation as indicated by the dashboard. Patients in the control group (CG) continued treatment without dose adaptations. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients in sustained clinical remission after 1 year. Results: Eighty patients were enrolled (66 CD, 14 UC), and the median [interquartile range] age was 37 years [27-51]). After one year, 28/32 (88%) of patients in the PG were in sustained clinical remission versus 25/39 (64%) in the CG (p = .017). PG patients had lower median faecal calprotectin levels after 1 year (p = .031), whereas no significant differences in median CRP levels were found. Conclusion: We demonstrated that the use of a Bayesian dashboard for IFX dosing in maintenance treatment for IBD reduced the incidence of LOR compared to standard dosing. Precision dosing also resulted in lower FCP levels. Clinicaltrials.gov number: NCT02453776. Keywords: Therapeutic drug monitoring; anti-TNF; gastroenterology; pharmacokinetics.",NCT02453776,Y,,,

Subject to posterior acceptability criteria to control the risk of severe toxicity and exclude unpromising doses, patients are randomized adaptively among the doses having posterior mean utilities near the maximum. The utility increment used to define near-optimality is nonincreasing with sample size. The adaptive randomization uses each dose's posterior probability of a set of good outcomes, defined by a lower utility cutoff. Saturated parametric models are assumed for the marginal dose-toxicity and dose-efficacy distributions, allowing the possible requirement of monotonicity in dose, and a copula is used to obtain a joint distribution. Prior means are computed by simulation using elicited outcome probabilities, and prior variances are calibrated to control prior effective sample size and obtain a design with good operating characteristics.

However, there are no biomarkers that are objective or easy-to-obtain in daily clinical practice, which leads to difficulties in assessing treatment response and developing new drugs. New technology allows quantification of features that clinicians perceive as reflective of disorder severity, such as facial expressions, phonic/speech information, body motion, daily activity, and sleep. Methods: Major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and major and minor neurocognitive disorders as well as healthy controls are recruited for the study. A psychiatrist/psychologist conducts conversational 10-min interviews with participants ?10 times within up to five years of follow-up. Interviews are recorded using RGB and infrared cameras, and an array microphone. As an option, participants are asked to wear wrist-band type devices during the observational period. Various software is used to process the raw video, voice, infrared, and wearable device data. A machine learning approach is used to predict the presence of symptoms, severity, and the improvement/deterioration of symptoms. Discussion: The overall goal of this proposed study, the Project for Objective Measures Using Computational Psychiatry Technology (PROMPT), is to develop objective, noninvasive, and easy-to-use biomarkers for assessing the severity of depressive and neurocognitive disorders in the hopes of guiding decision-making in clinical settings as well as reducing the risk of clinical trial failure. Challenges may include the large variability of samples, which makes it difficult to extract the features that commonly reflect disorder severity.

Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies are highly effective and have few side effects compared to older interferon-based therapy. Despite the Australian government providing subsidised and unrestricted access to DAA therapy for chronic HCV infection, uptake has not been sufficient to meet the global target of eliminating HCV as a public health threat by 2030. This study will offer people with HCV financial incentives of varying values in order to evaluate its effect on initiation of DAA therapy in primary care. Methods: Australian adults (18 years or older) who self-report as having current untreated HCV infection can register to participate via an automated SMS-based system. Following self-screening for eligibility, registrants are offered a financial incentive of randomised value (AUD 0 to 1000) to initiate DAA therapy. Study treatment navigators contact registrants who have consented to be contacted, to complete eligibility assessment, outline the study procedures (including the requirement for participants to consult a primary care provider), obtain consent, and finalise enrolment. Enrolled participants receive their offered incentive on provision of evidence of DAA therapy initiation within 12 weeks of registration (primary endpoint). Balanced randomisation is used across the incentive range until the first analysis, after which response-adaptive randomisation will be used to update the assignment probabilities. For the primary analysis, a Bayesian 4-parameter EMAX model will be used to estimate the dose-response curve and contrast treatment initiation at each incentive value against the control arm (AUD 0). Specified secondary statistical and economic analyses will evaluate the effect of incentives on adherence to DAA therapy, virological response, and cost-effectiveness. Discussion: This project seeks to gain an understanding of the dose-response relationship between incentive value and DAA treatment initiation, while maximising the number of people treated for HCV within fixed budget and time constraints. In doing so, we hope to offer policy-relevant recommendation(s) for the use of financial incentives as a pragmatic, efficient, and cost-effective approach to achieving elimination of HCV from Australia.

Erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of advanced NSCLC as second- or third-line therapy. This phase 2, randomized, multicenter, open-label study compared dinaciclib with erlotinib in patients with previously treated NSCLC. Materials and methods: The study was comprised of 2 parts: in part 1, patients were randomized to either intravenous (IV) dinaciclib (50 mg/m2) or oral erlotinib (150 mg) using an adaptive Bayesian design that adjusted the randomization ratio in favor of the more active arm, and in part 2, patients who had progressed on erlotinib were permitted to cross over to receive dinaciclib at the same dosage as in part 1. Patients were followed until disease progression or death, initiation of nonstudy cancer treatment, discontinuation, or withdrawal of consent. The primary efficacy end point was time-to-progression (TTP) in part 1 and objective response rate (ORR) in part 2. Results: Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, the median TTP was 1.49 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.31, 2.63) following initial treatment with dinaciclib, compared with 1.58 months (95% CI: 1.38, 2.83) with erlotinib. No objective responses were observed following initial treatment with dinaciclib. Common severe (grade 3 or 4) drug-related adverse effects included neutropenia, leukopenia, vomiting, and diarrhea. Conclusions: Dinaciclib, administered IV, was well tolerated at the 50 mg/m2 dose, but does not have activity as monotherapy in previously treated NSCLC. Evaluation of dinaciclib in combination with other agents for other indications including breast cancer and multiple myeloma is in progress. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00732810.

We report the associations between daily maximum apparent temperature and daily deaths during the warm season in 15 European cities. Methods: The city-specific analyses were based on generalized estimating equations and the city-specific results were combined in a Bayesian random effects meta-analysis. We specified distributed lag models in studying the delayed effect of exposure. Time-varying coefficient models were used to check the assumption of a constant heat effect over the warm season. Results: The city-specific exposure-response functions have a V shape, with a change-point that varied among cities. The meta-analytic estimate of the threshold was 29.4 degrees C for Mediterranean cities and 23.3 degrees C for north-continental cities. The estimated overall change in all natural mortality associated with a 1 degrees C increase in maximum apparent temperature above the city-specific threshold was 3.12% (95% credibility interval = 0.60% to 5.72%) in the Mediterranean region and 1.84% (0.06% to 3.64%) in the north-continental region. Stronger associations were found between heat and mortality from respiratory diseases, and with mortality in the elderly. Conclusions: There is an important mortality effect of heat across Europe. The effect is evident from June through August; it is limited to the first week following temperature excess, with evidence of mortality displacement. There is some suggestion of a higher effect of early season exposures. Acclimatization and individual susceptibility need further investigation as possible explanations for the observed heterogeneity among cities.",,Y,,,

This paradigm, however, is not suitable for some molecularly targeted agents, such as monoclonal antibodies, for which efficacy often increases initially with the dose and then plateaus. For molecularly targeted agents, the goal is to find the optimal dose, defined as the lowest safe dose that achieves the highest efficacy. We develop a Bayesian phase I/II dose-finding design to find the optimal dose. We employ a logistic model with a plateau parameter to capture the increasing-then-plateau feature of the dose-efficacy relationship. We take the weighted likelihood approach to accommodate for the case where efficacy is possibly late-onset. Based on observed data, we continuously update the posterior estimates of toxicity and efficacy probabilities and adaptively assign patients to the optimal dose. The simulation studies show that the proposed design has good operating characteristics. This method is going to be applied in more than two phase I clinical trials as no other method is available for this specific setting.

We aimed to assess the efficacy of doxycycline to treat suspected COVID-19 in the community among people at high risk of adverse outcomes. Methods: We did a national, open-label, multi-arm, adaptive platform randomised trial of interventions against COVID-19 in older people (PRINCIPLE) across primary care centres in the UK. We included people aged 65 years or older, or 50 years or older with comorbidities (weakened immune system, heart disease, hypertension, asthma or lung disease, diabetes, mild hepatic impairment, stroke or neurological problem, and self-reported obesity or body-mass index of 35 kg/m2 or greater), who had been unwell (for ?14 days) with suspected COVID-19 or a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community. Participants were randomly assigned using response adaptive randomisation to usual care only, usual care plus oral doxycycline (200 mg on day 1, then 100 mg once daily for the following 6 days), or usual care plus other interventions. The interventions reported in this manuscript are usual care plus doxycycline and usual care only; evaluations of other interventions in this platform trial are ongoing. The coprimary endpoints were time to first self-reported recovery, and hospitalisation or death related to COVID-19, both measured over 28 days from randomisation and analysed by intention to treat. This trial is ongoing and is registered with ISRCTN, 86534580. Findings: The trial opened on April 2, 2020. Randomisation to doxycycline began on July 24, 2020, and was stopped on Dec 14, 2020, because the prespecified futility criterion was met; 2689 participants were enrolled and randomised between these dates. Of these, 2508 (93·3%) participants contributed follow-up data and were included in the primary analysis: 780 (31·1%) in the usual care plus doxycycline group, 948 in the usual care only group (37·8%), and 780 (31·1%) in the usual care plus other interventions group. Among the 1792 participants randomly assigned to the usual care plus doxycycline and usual care only groups, the mean age was 61·1 years (SD 7·9); 999 (55·7%) participants were female and 790 (44·1%) were male. In the primary analysis model, there was little evidence of difference in median time to first self-reported recovery between the usual care plus doxycycline group and the usual care only group (9·6 [95% Bayesian Credible Interval [BCI] 8·3 to 11·0] days vs 10·1 [8·7 to 11·7] days, hazard ratio 1·04 [95% BCI 0·93 to 1·17]). The estimated benefit in median time to first self-reported recovery was 0·5 days [95% BCI -0·99 to 2·04] and the probability of a clinically meaningful benefit (defined as ?1·5 days) was 0·10. Hospitalisation or death related to COVID-19 occurred in 41 (crude percentage 5·3%) participants in the usual care plus doxycycline group and 43 (4·5%) in the usual care only group (estimated absolute percentage difference -0·5% [95% BCI -2·6 to 1·4]); there were five deaths (0·6%) in the usual care plus doxycycline group and two (0·2%) in the usual care only group. Interpretation: In patients with suspected COVID-19 in the community in the UK, who were at high risk of adverse outcomes, treatment with doxycycline was not associated with clinically meaningful reductions in time to recovery or hospital admissions or deaths related to COVID-19, and should not be used as a routine treatment for COVID-19.

Various methods for functional data analysis have been developed, including functional response regression methods that involve regression of a functional response on univariate/multivariate predictors with nonparametrically represented functional coefficients. In existing methods, however, the functional regression can be sensitive to outlying curves and outlying regions of curves, so is not robust. In this paper, we introduce a new Bayesian method, robust functional mixed models (R-FMM), for performing robust functional regression within the general functional mixed model framework, which includes multiple continuous or categorical predictors and random effect functions accommodating potential between-function correlation induced by the experimental design. The underlying model involves a hierarchical scale mixture model for the fixed effects, random effect and residual error functions. These modeling assumptions across curves result in robust nonparametric estimators of the fixed and random effect functions which down-weight outlying curves and regions of curves, and produce statistics that can be used to flag global and local outliers. These assumptions also lead to distributions across wavelet coefficients that have outstanding sparsity and adaptive shrinkage properties, with great flexibility for the data to determine the sparsity and the heaviness of the tails. Together with the down-weighting of outliers, these within-curve properties lead to fixed and random effect function estimates that appear in our simulations to be remarkably adaptive in their ability to remove spurious features yet retain true features of the functions. We have developed general code to implement this fully Bayesian method that is automatic, requiring the user to only provide the functional data and design matrices. It is efficient enough to handle large data sets, and yields posterior samples of all model parameters that can be used to perform desired Bayesian estimation and inference. Although we present details for a specific implementation of the R-FMM using specific distributional choices in the hierarchical model, 1D functions, and wavelet transforms, the method can be applied more generally using other heavy-tailed distributions, higher dimensional functions (e.g. images), and using other invertible transformations as alternatives to wavelets.",,Y,,,

Generally speaking, three parameters of the psychometric function are of interest: the performance threshold, the slope of the function, and the rate at which attention lapses occur. In the present study, three psychophysical procedures were used to estimate the three-parameter psychometric function for an auditory gap detection task. These were an up-down staircase (up-down) procedure, an entropy-based Bayesian (entropy) procedure, and an updated maximum-likelihood (UML) procedure. Data collected from four young, normal-hearing listeners showed that while all three procedures provided similar estimates of the threshold parameter, the up-down procedure performed slightly better in estimating the slope and lapse rate for 200 trials of data collection. When the lapse rate was increased by mixing in random responses for the three adaptive procedures, the larger lapse rate was especially detrimental to the efficiency of the up-down procedure, and the UML procedure provided better estimates of the threshold and slope than did the other two procedures.",,Y,,,

We consider designs in which subjects are randomized sequentially at decision points, among adaptive treatment options under evaluation. We present a sequential method to estimate the comparative effects of the randomized adaptive treatments, which are formalized as adaptive treatment strategies. Our causal estimators are derived using Bayesian predictive inference. We use analytical and empirical calculations to compare the predictive estimators to (i) the 'standard' approach that allocates the sequentially obtained data to separate strategy-specific groups as would arise from randomizing subjects at baseline; (ii) the semi-parametric approach of marginal mean models that, under appropriate experimental conditions, provides the same sequential estimator of causal differences as the proposed approach. Simulation studies demonstrate that sequential causal inference offers substantial efficiency gains over the standard approach to comparing treatments, because the predictive estimators can take advantage of the monotone structure of shared data among adaptive strategies. We further demonstrate that the semi-parametric asymptotic variances, which are marginal 'one-step' estimators, may exhibit significant bias, in contrast to the predictive variances. We show that the conditions under which the sequential method is attractive relative to the other two approaches are those most likely to occur in real studies.",,Y,,,

Previously, we showed that the postmovement increase in electroencephalographic (EEG) beta power over the sensorimotor cortex reflects neural processes that evaluate motor errors consistent with Bayesian inference (Tan et al., 2014). Whether such neural processes are limited to this cortical region or involve the basal ganglia is unclear. Here, we recorded EEG over the cortex and local field potential (LFP) activity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) from electrodes implanted in patients with Parkinson's disease, while they moved a joystick-controlled cursor to visual targets displayed on a computer screen. After movement offsets, we found increased beta activity in both local STN LFP and sensorimotor cortical EEG and in the coupling between the two, which was affected by both error magnitude and its contextual saliency. The postmovement increase in the coupling between STN and cortex was dominated by information flow from sensorimotor cortex to STN. However, an information drive appeared from STN to sensorimotor cortex in the first phase of the adaptation, when a constant rotation was applied between joystick inputs and cursor outputs. The strength of the STN to cortex drive correlated with the degree of adaption achieved across subjects. These results suggest that oscillatory activity in the beta band may dynamically couple the sensorimotor cortex and basal ganglia after movements. In particular, beta activity driven from the STN to cortex indicates task-relevant movement errors, information that may be important in modifying subsequent motor responses.

In this context, the present study aimed to assess the adaptability and stability of maize hybrids, by using the Bayesian segmented regression model, and evaluate the efficacy of using informative and minimally informative prior distributions for the selection of cultivars. Randomized complete-block design experiments were carried out to study the yield (kg/ha) of 25 maize hybrids, in 22 different environments, in Northeastern Brazil. The Bayesian segmented regression model fitted using informative prior distributions presented lower credibility intervals and Deviance Criterium of Information values, compared to those obtained by fitting using minimally informative distributions. Therefore, the model using informative prior distributions was considered for the adaptability and stability evaluation of maize genotypes.

In phase I clinical trials, most of the existing methodology recommends a one unique dose combination as ""optimal,"" which may result in a subsequent failed phase II clinical trial since other dose combinations may present higher treatment efficacy for the same level of toxicity. We are particularly interested in the setting where it is necessary to wait a few cycles of therapy to observe an efficacy outcome and the phase I and II population of patients are different with respect to treatment efficacy. Under these circumstances, it is common practice to implement two-stage designs where a set of maximum tolerated dose combinations is selected in a first stage, and then studied in a second stage for treatment efficacy. In this article we present a new two-stage design for early phase clinical trials with drug combinations. In the first stage, binary toxicity data is used to guide the dose escalation and set the maximum tolerated dose combinations. In the second stage, we take the set of maximum tolerated dose combinations recommended from the first stage, which remains fixed along the entire second stage, and through adaptive randomization, we allocate subsequent cohorts of patients in dose combinations that are likely to have high posterior median time to progression. The methodology is assessed with extensive simulations and exemplified with a real trial.

GSK315234 is a humanised anti-OSM Immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb). This 3-part study examines the safety, tolerability and efficacy of GSK315234 in patients with active RA. Method: This was a 3-part (Parts A, B and C), multicenter study. Part A and Part B were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Bayesian adaptive dose finding studies to investigate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single (Part A) and 3 repeat (Part B) intravenous infusions of GSK315234 in patients with active RA on a background of methotrexate (MTX). Part C was a single dose, randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess subcutaneously administered GSK315234 to patients with active RA on a background of MTX. Result: The primary endpoint of the study was mean change in DAS28 at Day 28 in Part A and Day 56 in Part B and C. All patients receiving at least one dose of GSK315234 were included in safety analysis. In Part A, there were statistically significant differences in DAS28 between 3 mg/kg and placebo at Day 56, 84 and 91. There was also a statistically significant difference in DAS28 between 0.3 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, as compared to placebo, at Day 84. Although these changes were small and occurred late, they supported progression to Part B and C to determine the therapeutic potential of GSK315234. For Part B, no significant difference was observed between 6 mg/kg and placebo. For Part C, a statistically significant difference in DAS28 was observed at Day 40, Day 84 and Day 100 between the 500 mg subcutaneous group, as compared to placebo. No significant findings were observed at any of the time points for EULAR response criteria, ACR20, ACR50 or ACR70. An exploratory analysis of clinical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics data suggests the lack of efficacy may be due to moderate binding affinity and rapid off-rate of GSK315234 as compared to the higher affinity OSM receptor causing a protein carrier effect prolonging the half life of OSM due to accumulation of the OSM/antibody complex in the serum and synovial fluid. Conclusion: Our data highlighted the importance of binding affinity and off-rate effect of a mAb to fully neutralize the target and how this may influence its efficacy and potentially worsen disease activity. Using an anti-OSM mAb with high affinity should test this hypothesis and examine the potential of OSM as a therapeutic target in RA.

These differences represent treatment by subgroup interaction. Peto defines qualitative interaction (QI) to occur when the simple treatment effect in one subgroup has a different sign than in another subgroup: this interaction is important. Interaction where the treatment effects are of the same sign in all subgroups is called quantitative and is often not important because the treatment recommendation is identical in all cases. A hierarchical model is used here with exchangeable mean responses to each treatment between subgroups. The posterior probability of QI and the corresponding Bayes factor are proposed as a diagnostic and as a test statistic. The model is motivated by two multi-center trials with binary responses. The frequentist power and size of the test using the Bayes factor are examined and compared with two other commonly used tests. The impact of imbalance between the sample sizes in each subgroup on power is examined, and the test based on the Bayes factor typically has better power for unbalanced designs, especially for small sample sizes. An exact test based on the Bayes factor is also suggested assuming the hierarchical model. The Bayes factor provides a concise summary of the evidence for or against QI. It is shown by example that it is easily adapted to summarize the evidence for 'clinically meaningful QI,' defined as the simple effects being of opposite signs and larger in absolute value than a minimal clinically meaningful effect.",,N,,,

The extended framework allows one to test for signals of selection in two ways: by comparing the patterns of population differentiation in quantitative traits and in neutral loci, and by comparing the similarity of habitats and phenotypes. We illustrate the framework using data on variation of eight morphological and behavioral traits among four populations of nine-spined sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius). In spite of the strong signal of genetic drift in the study system (average FST = 0.35 in neutral markers), strong footprints of adaptive population differentiation were uncovered both in morphological and behavioral traits.

Although effective interventions exist for common mental disorders that occur during pregnancy and the postpartum period, most cases in low- and middle-income countries go untreated because of a lack of trained professionals. Task-sharing models such as the Thinking Healthy Program have shown great potential in feasibility and efficacy trials as a strategy for expanding access to treatment in low-resource settings, but there are significant barriers to scale-up. We are addressing this gap by adapting Thinking Healthy for automated delivery via a mobile phone. This new intervention, Healthy Moms, uses an existing artificial intelligence system called Tess (Zuri in Kenya) to drive conversations with users. Objective: The objective of this pilot study is to test the Healthy Moms perinatal depression intervention using a single-case experimental design with pregnant women and new mothers recruited from public hospitals outside of Nairobi, Kenya. Methods: We will invite patients to complete a brief, automated screening delivered via text messages to determine their eligibility. Enrolled participants will be randomized to a 1- or 2-week baseline period and then invited to begin using Zuri. Participants will be prompted to rate their mood via short message service every 3 days during the baseline and intervention periods. We will review system logs and conduct in-depth interviews with participants to study engagement with the intervention, feasibility, and acceptability. We will use visual inspection, in-depth interviews, and Bayesian estimation to generate preliminary data about the potential response to treatment. Results: Our team adapted the intervention content in April and May 2018 and completed an initial prepilot round of formative testing with 10 women from a private maternity hospital in May and June. In preparation for this pilot study, we used feedback from these users to revise the structure and content of the intervention. Recruitment for this protocol began in early 2019. Results are expected toward the end of 2019. Conclusions: The main limitation of this pilot study is that we will recruit women who live in urban and periurban centers in one part of Kenya. The results of this study may not generalize to the broader population of Kenyan women, but that is not an objective of this phase of work.

Sequentially adaptive decisions are based on the joint utility of the two event times. A utility function is constructed by partitioning the two-dimensional positive real quadrant of possible event time pairs into rectangles, eliciting a numerical utility for each rectangle, and fitting a smooth parametric function to the elicited values. We assume that each event time follows a gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters both modeled as functions of schedule and dose. A copula is assumed to obtain a bivariate distribution. To ensure an ethical trial, adaptive safety and efficacy acceptability conditions are imposed on the (schedule, dose) regimes. In stage 1 of the design, patients are randomized fairly among schedules and, within each schedule, a dose is chosen using a hybrid algorithm that either maximizes posterior mean utility or randomizes among acceptable doses. In stage 2, fair randomization among schedules is replaced by the hybrid algorithm. A modified version of this algorithm is used for nested schedules. Extensions of the model and utility function to accommodate death or discontinuation of follow up are described. The method is illustrated by an autologous stem cell transplantation trial in multiple myeloma, including a simulation study.

The proposed model represents each Lidar waveform as a combination of a known impulse response, weighted by the target reflectivity, and an unknown constant background, corrupted by Poisson noise. Prior knowledge about the problem is embedded through prior distributions that account for the different parameter constraints and their spatial correlation among the image pixels. In particular, a gamma Markov random field (MRF) is used to model the joint distribution of the target reflectivity, and a second MRF is used to model the distribution of the target depth, which are both expected to exhibit significant spatial correlations. An adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is then proposed to perform Bayesian inference. This algorithm is equipped with a stochastic optimization adaptation mechanism that automatically adjusts the parameters of the MRFs by maximum marginal likelihood estimation.

EWOC has been used by clinicians to design many cancer Phase I clinical trials, see e.g. [1-4]. However, this design treats the toxicity response as a binary indicator of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and does not account for the number and specific grades of toxicities experienced by patients during the trial. Chen et al. (2010) proposed a novel toxicity score system to fully utilize all toxicity information using a normalized equivalent toxicity score (NETS). In this paper, we propose to incorporate NETS into EWOC using a quasi-Bernoulli likelihood approach to design cancer Phase I clinical trials. We call the design escalation with overdose control using normalized equivalent toxicity score (EWOC-NETS). Simulation results show that this design has good operating characteristics and improves the accuracy of MTD, trial efficiency, therapeutic effect, and overdose control relative to EWOC which is used as a representative of designs treating toxicity response as a binary indicator of DLT.

The probabilistic reversal-learning task may be an effective way to examine dysfunction associated with cocaine addiction. However the exact nature of the performance deficits observed in cocaine users has yet to be disambiguated. Method: Data from a probabilistic reversal-learning task performed by 45 cocaine users and 41 controls was compared and fit to a Bayesian hidden Markov model (HMM). Results: Cocaine users demonstrated the predicted performance deficit in achieving the reversal criterion relative to controls. The deficit appeared to be due to excessive switching behavior as evidenced by responsivity to false feedback and spontaneous switching. This decision-making behavior could be captured by a single parameter in an HMM and did not require an additional parameter to represent perseverative errors. Conclusions: Cocaine users are characterized by excessive switching behavior on the reversal-learning task. While there may be a compulsive component to behavior on this task, impulsive decision-making may be more relevant to observed impairment. This is important in building diagnostic tools to quantify the degree to which each type of dysfunction is present in individuals, and may play a role in developing treatments for those dysfunctions.

We discuss five novel challenges to the design and conduct of a large, multicenter, randomized trial during a pandemic, including 1) widespread, off-label use of the study drug before the availability of safety and efficacy data; 2) the need to adapt traditional procedures for documentation of informed consent during an infectious pandemic; 3) developing a flexible and robust Bayesian analysis incorporating significant uncertainty about the disease, outcomes, and treatment; 4) obtaining indistinguishable drug and placebo without delaying enrollment; and 5) rapidly obtaining administrative and regulatory approvals. Our goals in describing how the ORCHID trial progressed from study conception to enrollment of the first patient in 15 days are to inform the development of other high-quality, multicenter trials targeting COVID-19. We describe lessons learned to improve the efficiency of future clinical trials, particularly in the setting of pandemics.

It is an inferentially based, statistically principled procedure that allows comparison of nonnested models using the Bayesian information criterion to compare multiple models and identify the optimum number of clusters. The current study clustered 36 young men and women on the basis of their baseline heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV), chronic alcohol use, and reasons for drinking. Two cluster groups were identified and labeled the high alcohol risk and normative groups. Compared to the normative group, individuals in the high alcohol risk group had higher levels of alcohol use and more strongly endorsed disinhibition and suppression reasons for use. The high alcohol risk group showed significant HRV changes in response to positive and negative emotional and appetitive picture cues, compared to neutral cues. In contrast, the normative group showed a significant HRV change only to negative cues. Findings suggest that individuals with autonomic self-regulatory difficulties may be more susceptible to heavy alcohol use and use of alcohol for emotional regulation.",,Y,,,

As different traits of an organism covary, genetic correlations are expected to affect evolutionary trajectories. However, only limited empirical data are available. Methodology/principal findings: We investigate the extent to which multivariate constraints affect the rate of adaptation, focusing on four morphological traits often shown to harbour large amounts of genetic variance and considered to be subject to limited evolutionary constraints. Our data set includes unique long-term data for seven bird species and a total of 10 populations. We estimate population-specific matrices of genetic correlations and multivariate selection coefficients to predict evolutionary responses to selection. Using Bayesian methods that facilitate the propagation of errors in estimates, we compare (1) the rate of adaptation based on predicted response to selection when including genetic correlations with predictions from models where these genetic correlations were set to zero and (2) the multivariate evolvability in the direction of current selection to the average evolvability in random directions of the phenotypic space. We show that genetic correlations on average decrease the predicted rate of adaptation by 28%. Multivariate evolvability in the direction of current selection was systematically lower than average evolvability in random directions of space. These significant reductions in the rate of adaptation and reduced evolvability were due to a general nonalignment of selection and genetic variance, notably orthogonality of directional selection with the size axis along which most (60%) of the genetic variance is found. Conclusions: These results suggest that genetic correlations can impose significant constraints on the evolution of avian morphology in wild populations. This could have important impacts on evolutionary dynamics and hence population persistence in the face of rapid environmental change.",,Y,,,

Early phase clinical trials are inherently heterogeneous due to their exploratory nature. The process of identifying an optimal dose involves careful considerations of the patient population, evaluation of therapeutic potential, and exploration of the dose-response and dose-toxicity relationships to ensure that it is safe and effective for the intended use. However, the complex mechanism of actions and uncertainties during dose optimization often introduce substantial gaps between those early phase trials and phase 3 randomized control trials. These gaps can indeed increase the chances of failure. To address these challenges, we propose a novel seamless phase I/II design, namely DOD-BART design, which utilizes machine learning technique, specifically Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) to fully incorporate patient-level prognostic factors and outcomes. Our design provides a streamlined approach for dose exploration and optimization, automatically updated with emerging data to allocate patients to the most promising dose levels. DOD-BART elucidates disease relationships, analyzes and synthesizes emerging data, augments operational efficiency, and guides dose optimization for suitable population. Simulation studies demonstrate the robust performances of the DOD-BART design across a variety of realistic settings, with high probabilities of correctly identifying the optimal dose, allocating patients more to tolerable and efficacious dose levels, making less biased estimates, and efficiently utilizing patients' data.

Adaptations to traditional trial logistics and design to allow rapid implementation, evaluation of trials within a global trials context, flexible interim monitoring, and access outside traditional research hospitals (even in settings where formal placebos are unavailable) may be helpful. Thoughtful adaptations to traditional trial designs, especially within the global context of related studies, may also foster collaborative relationships among government, community, and the research enterprise. Here, we describe the protocol for a pragmatic, active comparator trial in as many as 300 patients comparing two current ""off-label"" treatments for COVID-19-hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin-in academic and nonacademic hospitals in Utah. We developed the trial in response to local pressures for widespread, indiscriminate off-label use of these medications.

However, in certain vulnerable populations, such as neonates or infants, there is an heightened requirement for safety, precluding randomization. Purpose: To estimate the minimum effective dose of a new drug from a non-cancer phase II trial, we propose the use of adaptive designs like the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM). This approach estimates the dose closest to some target response, and has been shown to be unbiased and efficient in cancer phase I trials. Methods: Based on a motivating example, we point out the individual influence of first outliers in this setting. A weighted version of the CRM is proposed as a theoretical benchmark to control for these outliers. Using simulations, we illustrate how this approach provides further insight into the behavior of the CRM. Results: When dealing with low targets like a 10% failure rate, the CRM appears unable to rapidly overcome an early unexpected outcome. This behavior persisted despite changing the inference (Bayesian or likelihood), underlying dose-response model (though slightly improved using the power model), and the number of patients enrolled at each dose level. Limitations: The choices for initial guesses of failure rates, the vague prior for the model parameter, and the log-log shape of weights can appear somewhat arbitrary. Conclusions: In phase II dose-finding studies in which failure targets are below 20%, the CRM appears quite sensitive to first unexpected outcomes. Using a power model for dose-response improves some behavior if the trial is started at the first dose level and includes at least three to five patients at the starting dose before applying the CRM allocation rule.",,Y,,,

Methods: A total 27 physically active males were randomly assigned to a heavy loads group (HLG, n=9), low loads group (LLG, n=9), and control group (CG, n=9). Participants performed 12 training sessions during 6 weeks (2 sessions per week), and each training session consisted in performing 8 cycling sprints against either heavy (HLG) or light (LLG) resistances. Before and after intervention, they performed an identical protocol, which consisted in performing maximal cycling sprints against 5 different resistances in random order. In these protocols, IOP was measured before and after each sprint by rebound tonometry. Results: A Bayesian analysis revealed that baseline IOP was reduced in the LLG after the intervention [Bayes factor (BF01)=0.043 and effect size (ES)=1.255; pretest=15.22±0.94 mm Hg and posttest=15.39±1.02 mm Hg], whereas the HLG did not manifest any baseline IOP change (BF01=2.363 and ES=-0.205; pretest=15.28±1.44 mm Hg and posttest=14.17±1.77 mm Hg). The acute IOP response to maximal sprints was modified for the HLG, showing a more stable IOP response with heavier loads (resistance, 4 and 5) after the intervention (BF01<0.01 in both cases, and ESs=1.847 and 1.920, respectively). Conclusions: A short-term cycle ergometer sprint training impacts long-term IOP depending on the level of resistance imposed, showing that training with low loads permits to reduce baseline IOP, whereas training with heavy loads attenuates the acute IOP changes after sprinting against heavy loads.",,Y,,,

Inhibition of FAAH is hypothesized to reduce the excitability of urinary tract afferents including nociceptors. Materials and methods: In this adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, adult male patients with moderate to severe CP/CPPS were treated for 12 weeks with an oral dose of ASP3652 (25, 75, 150, or 300 mg twice daily, or 300 mg once daily), or placebo. A Bayesian model was used for adaptive prospective modeling of randomization, study continuation decisions, and analysis of the efficacy variables. Results: The study was stopped for futility at preplanned interim analysis when 239 patients were randomized (226 were included in the intention-to-treat set): the 25 mg group showed the largest reduction of the primary end point National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index total score (7.0 points), but the placebo group showed a mean reduction of 7.3 points (difference: 0.3 [95% confidence interval: -1.9, 2.6]). Micturition outcomes improved compared with placebo in all ASP3652 groups; for example, in the 300 mg twice daily group, voiding frequency decreased by -1.10 (95% CI: -2.0, -0.2) voids/24 hours vs placebo. Safety outcomes were comparable across the treatment groups. Conclusion: ASP3652 was generally safe and well-tolerated. It did not show efficacy on pain symptoms in patients with CP/CPPS. However, the results indicate that FAAH inhibition may attenuate lower urinary tract symptoms. Dedicated studies in patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction are needed to confirm this.",,Y,,,

We evaluated the pan-Akt inhibitor MK-2206 in combination with standard therapy in patients with high-risk early-stage breast cancer. Patients and methods: I-SPY 2 is a multicenter, phase II, open-label, adaptively randomized neoadjuvant platform trial that screens experimental therapies and efficiently identifies potential predictive biomarker signatures. Patients are categorized by human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), hormone receptor (HR), and MammaPrint statuses in a 2 × 2 × 2 layout. Patients within each of these 8 biomarker subtypes are adaptively randomly assigned to one of several experimental therapies, including MK-2206, or control. Therapies are evaluated for 10 biomarker signatures, each of which is a combination of these subtypes. The primary end point is pathologic complete response (pCR). A therapy graduates with one or more of these signatures if and when it has an 85% Bayesian predictive probability of success in a hypothetical phase III trial, adjusting for biomarker covariates. Patients in the current report received standard taxane- and anthracycline-based neoadjuvant therapy without (control) or with oral MK-2206 135 mg/week. Results: MK-2206 graduated with 94 patients and 57 concurrently randomly assigned controls in 3 graduation signatures: HR-negative/HER2-positive, HR-negative, and HER2-positive. Respective Bayesian mean covariate-adjusted pCR rates and percentage probability that MK-2206 is superior to control were 0.48:0.29 (97%), 0.62:0.36 (99%), and 0.46:0.26 (94%). In exploratory analyses, MK-2206 evinced a numerical improvement in event-free survival in its graduating signatures. The most significant grade 3-4 toxicity was rash (14% maculopapular, 8.6% acneiform). Conclusion: The Akt inhibitor MK-2206 combined with standard neoadjuvant therapy resulted in higher estimated pCR rates in HR-negative and HER2-positive breast cancer.

Many patients fail during induction and others respond initially but relapse during maintenance therapy. Although anti-drug antibodies (ADA) are associated with some clinical failures, there is evidence that some failures may be due to subtherapeutic exposure. Adapting doses based on clinical outcomes and trough concentrations can improve response and reduce the proportion that develop ADA, but identification of appropriate doses in the presence of time-varying patient factors is complicated. Several adaptive dosing strategies (label recommendations versus therapeutic drug monitoring with an established stepwise algorithm or proportional dose adjustments or Bayesian population pharmacokinetic model-based dosing) were simulated on a virtual population (constructed with time-varying covariates and random effects on individual pharmacokinetic parameters) using R to assess their relative performance. Strategies were evaluated on their ability to maintain trough infliximab concentrations above an established target, 3 mg/L, during maintenance phase. Model-based dosing was superior in maintaining target trough concentrations, showing individuals in maintenance achieving concentrations above the target faster and a lower proportion of individuals who developed ADA. Model-based dosing results were consistent across a range of baseline covariate groups. This in silico assessment of adaptive dosing strategies demonstrated that, when challenged with dynamic covariate and random effect changes occurring in individual pharmacokinetic parameters, model-based approaches were superior to other strategies. Model-based dosing has not been tested clinically; however, the potential benefits of model-based dosing for infliximab suggest that it should be investigated to reduce subtherapeutic exposure.

Subjects used a manipulandum to attempt to keep a displayed cursor at the center of a screen despite random perturbations to its location. Cross-correlation analysis of the perturbation and the subject response showed no age-related increase in latency until the onset of response to the perturbation, but substantial slowing of the response itself. Results are consistent with age-related deterioration in the ratio of signal to noise in visuomotor response. The task is such that it is tractable to use Bayesian and quadratic optimality assumptions to construct a model for behavior. This model assumes that behavior resembles an optimal controller subject to noise, and parametrizes response in terms of latency, willingness to expend effort, noise intensity, and noise bandwidth. The model is consistent with the data for all young (n = 12, age 20-30) and most elderly (n = 12, age 65-92) subjects. The model reproduces the latency result from the cross-correlation method. When presented with increased noise, the computational model reproduces the experimentally observed age-related slowing and the observed lack of increased latency. The model provides a precise way to quantitatively formulate the long-standing hypothesis that age-related slowing is an adaptation to increased noise.",,Y,,,

Unsuccessful implementation of CER results limits the value of even the highest quality trials. Planning for a trial comparing two standard strategies of insulin administration for hospitalized patients led us to develop a new method for a clinical trial designed to be embedded directly into the clinical care setting thereby lowering the cost, increasing the pragmatic nature of the overall trial, strengthening implementation, and creating an integrated environment of research-based care. Purpose: We describe a novel randomized clinical trial that uses the informatics and statistics infrastructure of the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System (VA) to illustrate one key component (called the point-of-care clinical trial - POC-CT) of a 'learning healthcare system,' and settles a clinical question of interest to the VA. Methods: This study is an open-label, randomized trial comparing sliding scale regular insulin to a weight-based regimen for control of hyperglycemia, using the primary outcome length of stay, in non-ICU inpatients within the northeast region of the VA. All non-ICU patients who require in-hospital insulin therapy are eligible for the trial, and the VA's automated systems will be used to assess eligibility and present the possibility of randomization to the clinician at the point of care. Clinicians will indicate their approval for informed consent to be obtained by study staff. Adaptive randomization will assign up to 3000 patients, preferentially to the currently 'winning' strategy, and all care will proceed according to usual practices. Based on a Bayesian stopping rule, the study has acceptable frequentist operating characteristics (Type I error 6%, power 86%) against a 12% reduction of median length of stay from 5 to 4.4 days. The adaptive stopping rule promotes implementation of a successful treatment strategy. Limitations: Despite clinical equipoise, individual healthcare providers may have strong treatment preferences that jeopardize the success and implementation of the trial design, leading to low rates of randomization. Unblinded treatment assignment may bias results. In addition, generalization of clinical results to other healthcare systems may be limited by differences in patient population. Generalizability of the POC-CT method depends on the level of informatics and statistics infrastructure available to a healthcare system. Conclusions: The methods proposed will demonstrate outcome-based evaluation of control of hyperglycemia in hospitalized veterans. By institutionalizing a process of statistically sound and efficient learning, and by integrating that learning with automatic implementation of best practice, the participating VA Healthcare Systems will accelerate improvements in the effectiveness of care.",,Y,,,

Preoperative treatment with cabozantinib and nivolumab led to >99% reduction in alpha-fetoprotein, -37.3% radiographic reduction by RECIST 1.1 and a near complete pathologic response (80% to 100% necrosis). An integrated immunological analysis was performed on the post-treatment surgical tumor sample and matched pre-treatment and post-treatment peripheral blood samples with high-dimensional imaging and cytometry techniques. Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization (CoGAPS, Coordinated Gene Activity in Pattern Sets) and self-organizing map (FlowSOM) algorithms were used to distinguish changes in functional markers across cellular neighborhoods in the single cell data sets. Brisk immunological infiltration into the tumor microenvironment was observed in non-random, organized cellular neighborhoods. Systemically, combination therapy led to marked promotion of effector cytotoxic T cells and effector memory helper T cells. Natural killer cells also increased with therapy.

In this article, we establish a general framework for a multi-stage adaptive design where we jointly model a continuous efficacy outcome and continuous/quasi-continuous toxicity endpoints from multiple treatment cycles. The normalized Total Toxicity Profile (nTTP) is used as an illustration for quasi-continuous toxicity endpoints, and we replace DLT with nTTP to take into account multiple grades and types of toxicities. In addition, the proposed design accommodates non-monotone dose-efficacy relationships, and longitudinal toxicity data in effort to capture the adverse events from multiple cycles. Stage 1 of our design uses toxicity data to perform dose-escalation and identify a set of initially allowable (safe) doses; stage 2 of our design incorporates an efficacy outcome to update the set of allowable doses for each new cohort and randomizes the new cohort of patients to the allowable doses with emphasis towards those with higher predicted efficacy. Stage 3 uses all data from all treated patients at the end of the trial to make final recommendations. Simulations showed that the design had a high probability of making the correct dose selection and good overdose control across various dose-efficacy and dose-toxicity scenarios. In addition, the proposed design allows for early termination when all doses are too toxic. To our best knowledge, the proposed dual-endpoint dose-finding design is the first such study to incorporate multiple cycles of toxicities and a continuous efficacy outcome.

In addition, pharmacokinetic variables were calculated. Gentamicin therapy was started at a dose of 5 mg/kg per day under individual dose or dosage interval adjustments to achieve target levels. Fifty-two infants and children aged 1 month (postterm) to 16 years were enrolled. The duration of fever from the start of therapy, the percentage decline of C-reactive protein (CRP) on day 3 of treatment, and the clinical outcome were used as efficacy parameters. Nephrotoxicity was evaluated using creatinine serum levels. Basic characteristics in both groups were comparable. A good clinical response was observed in both groups. Fever may have resolved faster with multiple-daily administration, but this was not statistically significant. The percentage of decline of CRP was also comparable in both groups. Nephrotoxicity occurred in six patients, three per group. Many patients were too ill or too young to perform hearing tests, but no clinical signs of ototoxicity were observed. Mean doses of 6.8 mg/kg per day (multiple-daily administration) and 7.3 mg/kg per day (once-daily administration) were necessary to meet the target gentamicin levels. Triple-daily doses had to be reduced to a twice-daily regimen in 17 of 26 children. Dose and dosage interval adaptations can be performed by Bayesian forecasting using a one-compartment model with one set of K(e) and V(d) parameters.

In computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction, it is important but challenging to preserve the texture when lowering x-ray exposure from full- toward low-/ultra-low dose level. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the texture-dose relationship within one tissue-specific pre-log Bayesian CT reconstruction algorithm. Methods: To enhance the texture in ultra-low dose CT (ULdCT) reconstruction, this paper presents a Bayesian type algorithm. A shifted Poisson model is adapted to describe the statistical properties of pre-log data, and a tissue-specific Markov random field prior (MRFt) is used to incorporate tissue texture from previous full-dose CT, thus called SP-MRFt algorithm. Utilizing the SP-MRFt algorithm, we investigated tissue texture degradation as a function of x-ray dose levels from full dose (100 mAs/120 kVp) to ultralow dose (1 mAs/120 kVp) by using quantitative texture-based evaluation metrics. Results: Experimental results show the SP-MRFt algorithm outperforms conventional filtered back projection (FBP) and post-log domain penalized weighted least square MRFt (PWLS-MRFt) in terms of noise suppression and texture preservation. Comparable results are also obtained with shifted Poisson model with 7 × 7 Huber MRF weights (SP-Huber7). The investigation on texture-dose relationship shows that the quantified texture measures drop monotonically as dose level decreases, and interestingly a turning point is observed on the texture-dose response curve. Conclusions: This important observation implies that there exists a minimum dose level, at which a given CT scanner (hardware configuration and image reconstruction software) can achieve without compromising clinical tasks. Moreover, the experiment results show that the variance of electronic noise has higher impact than the mean to the texture-dose relationship.

AAB-003 was developed by modifying bapineuzumab to reduce Fc-receptor-mediated effector function as a strategy to reduce the removal of amyloid from vessel walls associated with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema/effusions (ARIA-E) without diminishing overall amyloid clearance. Methods: Eighty-eight patients with AD received up to three infusions of AAB-003 (or placebo) 13 weeks apart at doses of 0.5, 1, 2, 4 or 8 mg/kg in the FIH trial. Dose escalation was based on safety data reviews using a Bayesian escalation algorithm. Subjects who completed the FIH study were permitted to enter a 1-year open-label extension trial with four additional intravenous infusions of AAB-003 (NCT01369225; registered 10 May 2011). Results: Dose-dependent increases in plasma amyloid ? and AAB-003 were observed. No significant changes in cerebral spinal fluid biomarkers were observed. Pharmacokinetics elimination half-life (21-28 days) clearance and volume of distribution values were consistent across dose groups indicating linearity. ARIA-E was the most notable safety finding detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 8 mg/kg in two patients. Three cases of microhemorrhage were observed. No new safety findings or MRI abnormalities were observed for the 52 subjects who received AAB-003 in the extension trial. Conclusion: Based on integrated review of laboratory, electrocardiogram, adverse events, and MRI, AAB-003 was safe and well tolerated up to 8 mg/kg for up to 91 weeks (FIH and extension trials) in patients with mild to moderate AD. Asymptomatic and resolvable ARIA-E was observed after the first or second infusion of AAB-003, similar to bapineuzumab. The AAB-003 dose at which ARIA-E was observed was higher compared to bapineuzumab, supporting the hypothesis that reducing Fc-receptor effector function may reduce the ARIA associated with monoclonal antibodies targeting cerebral amyloid.",NCT01193608,Y,,,

At least one between-person factor is crossed with at least one within-person factor, and the persons nested within the levels of the between-person factor are crossed with the items within levels of the within-person factor. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of models for binary data with crossed random effects is challenging. This is because the marginal likelihood does not have a closed form, so that MLE requires numerical or Monte Carlo integration. In addition, the multidimensional structure of MIRPs makes the estimation complex. In this paper, three different estimation methods to meet these challenges are described: the Laplace approximation to the integrand; hierarchical Bayesian analysis, a simulation-based method; and an alternating imputation posterior with adaptive quadrature as the approximation to the integral. In addition, this paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these three estimation methods for MIRPs. The three algorithms are compared in a real data application and a simulation study was also done to compare their behaviour.",,Y,,,

Therapy is continued to the next stage if the patient's disease is stable, and is discontinued if either tumour response or treatment failure is observed. We assume a probability model that accounts for baseline covariates and the multi-stage treatment and disease evaluation structure. The design uses covariate-adjusted adaptive randomization based on a score that combines the patient's probabilities of overall treatment success or failure. The adaptive randomization procedure generalizes the method proposed by Thompson (1933) for two binomial distributions with beta priors.

We compared two doses of ATG (4.5 mg/kg and 7.5 mg/kg) in a Bayesian adaptively randomized fashion, and assessed whether ATG levels measured on days 0, 7, 14 and 28 were associated with clinical outcomes. Treatment success was defined as the patient being alive, engrafted, in remission and without acute GVHD at day 100. Twenty patients received ATG 4.5 mg/kg (n = 15) or 7.5 mg/kg (n = 5) with reduced-intensity conditioning followed by unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplant. The first 10 patients were fairly randomized, but the next 10 patients were adaptively randomized to the arm with higher success rate (4.5 mg/kg arm in this trial). The posterior mean treatment success rates for the ATG 4.5 mg/kg and ATG 7.5 mg/kg arms were 0.73 and 0.45, respectively. The posterior probability that the success rate was greater in the 4.5 mg/kg arm than in the 7.5 mg/kg arm was 0.93. There was no difference in the overall survival (p = 0.607), relapse-free survival (p = 0.607), treatment-related mortality (p = 0.131) or incidence of acute (p = 0.303) or chronic GVHD (p = 0.999) between the two doses. ATG levels were not associated with clinical outcomes. Thus, our results favor the use of ATG 4.5 mg/kg over ATG 7.5 mg/kg in patients undergoing unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplant with reduced-intensity conditioning regimens.",,Y,,,

However, performances of these algorithms in racially diverse group have never been objectively evaluated and compared. In this literature-based study, we compared the performances of eight machine learning techniques with those of MLR in a large, racially-diverse cohort. Methods: MLR, artificial neural network (ANN), regression tree (RT), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), boosted regression tree (BRT), support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR), lasso regression (LAR) and Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) were applied in warfarin dose algorithms in a cohort from the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium database. Covariates obtained by stepwise regression from 80% of randomly selected patients were used to develop algorithms. To compare the performances of these algorithms, the mean percentage of patients whose predicted dose fell within 20% of the actual dose (mean percentage within 20%) and the mean absolute error (MAE) were calculated in the remaining 20% of patients. The performances of these techniques in different races, as well as the dose ranges of therapeutic warfarin were compared. Robust results were obtained after 100 rounds of resampling. Results: BART, MARS and SVR were statistically indistinguishable and significantly out performed all the other approaches in the whole cohort (MAE: 8.84-8.96 mg/week, mean percentage within 20%: 45.88%-46.35%). In the White population, MARS and BART showed higher mean percentage within 20% and lower mean MAE than those of MLR (all p values < 0.05). In the Asian population, SVR, BART, MARS and LAR performed the same as MLR. MLR and LAR optimally performed among the Black population. When patients were grouped in terms of warfarin dose range, all machine learning techniques except ANN and LAR showed significantly higher mean percentage within 20%, and lower MAE (all p values < 0.05) than MLR in the low- and high- dose ranges. Conclusion: Overall, machine learning-based techniques, BART, MARS and SVR performed superior than MLR in warfarin pharmacogenetic dosing. Differences of algorithms' performances exist among the races. Moreover, machine learning-based algorithms tended to perform better in the low- and high- dose ranges than MLR.",,Y,,,

Methods: Twenty-eight children, 1.1 to 18.0 years old, received oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) therapy combined with either tacrolimus (n= 23) or ciclosporin (n= 5). The population parameters were estimated from a model-building set of 16 intensive pharmacokinetic datasets obtained from 16 children. The data were analyzed by nonlinear mixed effect modelling, using a one compartment model with first order absorption and first order elimination and random effects on the absorption rate (k(a)), the apparent volume of distribution (V/F) and apparent clearance (CL/F). Results: Two covariates, time since transplantation (? and >6 months) and age affected MPA pharmacokinetics. k(a), estimated at 1.7 h(-1) at age 8.7 years, exhibited large interindividual variability (308%). V/F, estimated at 64.7 l, increased about 2.3 times in children during the immediate post transplantation period. This increase was due to the increase in the unbound MPA fraction caused by the low albumin concentration. CL/F was estimated at 12.7 l h(-1). To estimate individual AUC(0,12 h), the pharmacokinetic parameters obtained with the final model, including covariates, were coded in Adapt II(®) software, using the Bayesian approach. The AUC(0,12 h) estimated from concentrations measured 0, 1 and 4 h after administration of MMF did not differ from reference values. Conclusions: This study allowed the estimation of the population pharmacokinetic MPA parameters. A simple sampling procedure is suggested to help to optimize pediatric patient care.",,Y,,,

Speed and accuracy of perceptual decisions covary with certainty in the input, and correlate with the rate of evidence accumulation in parietal and frontal cortical ""decision neurons"". A biophysically realistic model of interactions within and between Retina/LGN and cortical areas V1, MT, MST, and LIP, gated by basal ganglia, simulates dynamic properties of decision-making in response to ambiguous visual motion stimuli used by Newsome, Shadlen, and colleagues in their neurophysiological experiments. The model clarifies how brain circuits that solve the aperture problem interact with a recurrent competitive network with self-normalizing choice properties to carry out probabilistic decisions in real time. Some scientists claim that perception and decision-making can be described using Bayesian inference or related general statistical ideas, that estimate the optimal interpretation of the stimulus given priors and likelihoods. However, such concepts do not propose the neocortical mechanisms that enable perception, and make decisions. The present model explains behavioral and neurophysiological decision-making data without an appeal to Bayesian concepts and, unlike other existing models of these data, generates perceptual representations and choice dynamics in response to the experimental visual stimuli. Quantitative model simulations include the time course of LIP neuronal dynamics, as well as behavioral accuracy and reaction time properties, during both correct and error trials at different levels of input ambiguity in both fixed duration and reaction time tasks. Model MT/MST interactions compute the global direction of random dot motion stimuli, while model LIP computes the stochastic perceptual decision that leads to a saccadic eye movement.",,Y,,,

Our objective in this study was to investigate potential causal biological relationships between reproductive performance traits in high-producing gilts and sows. Data originated from a nutrition experiment and consisted of 200 sows and 440 gilts arranged in body weight blocks and randomly assigned to dietary treatments during late gestation at a commercial swine farm. Reproductive performance traits consisted of weight gain during late gestation, total number born and number born alive in a litter, born alive average birth weight, wean-to-estrous interval, and total litter size born in the subsequent farrowing. Structural equation models combined with the inductive causation algorithm, both adapted to a hierarchical Bayesian framework, were employed to search for, estimate, and infer upon causal links between the traits within each parity group. Results indicated potentially distinct reproductive networks for gilts and for sows. Sows showed sparse connectivity between reproductive traits, whereas the network learned for gilts was densely interconnected, suggesting closely linked physiological mechanisms in younger females, with a potential for ripple effects throughout their productive lifecycle in response to early implementation of tailored managerial interventions. Cross-validation analyses indicated substantial network stability both for the general structure and for individual links, though results about directionality of such links were unstable in this study and will need further investigation. An assessment of relative statistical power in sows and gilts indicated that the observed network discrepancies may be partially explained on a biological basis. In summary, our results suggest distinctly heterogeneous mechanistic networks of reproductive physiology for gilts and sows, consistent with physiological differences between the groups. These findings have potential practical implications for integrated understanding and differential management of gilts and sows to enhance efficiency of swine production systems.

Improved GVHD prevention methods are needed. Pentostatin, an adenosine deaminase inhibitor, leads to lymphocyte depletion with low risk of myelosuppression. We hypothesized that addition of pentostatin to GVHD prophylaxis with tacrolimus and mini-methotrexate may improve outcomes, and we conducted a Bayesian adaptively randomized, controlled, dose-finding study, taking into account toxicity and efficacy. Patients and methods: Success was defined as the patient being alive, engrafted, in remission, without GVHD 100 days post-HSCT and no grade ? 3 GVHD at any time. Patients were randomly assigned to pentostatin doses of 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/m(2) with drug administered on HSCT days 8, 15, 22, and 30.

The posterior probabilities that the success rates were greater with 1.5 mg/m(2) or 1.0 mg/m(2) versus control are 0.944 and 0.821, respectively. Hepatic aGVHD rates were 0%, 17.2%, and 11.1%, respectively, for 1.5 mg/m(2), 1.0 mg/m(2), and control groups.

The FMM relates a functional response to a set of predictors through functional fixed and random effects, which allows it to account for various factors and between-function correlations. The methods include training and prediction steps. In the training steps we train the FMM model by treating class designation as one of the fixed effects, and in the prediction steps we classify the new objects using posterior predictive probabilities of class. Through a Bayesian scheme, we are able to adjust for factors affecting both the functions and the class designations. While the methods can be used in any FMM framework, we provide details for two specific Bayesian approaches: the Gaussian, wavelet-based FMM (G-WFMM) and the robust, wavelet-based FMM (R-WFMM). Both methods perform modeling in the wavelet space, which yields parsimonious representations for the functions, and can naturally adapt to local features and complex nonstationarities in the functions. The R-WFMM allows potentially heavier tails for features of the functions indexed by particular wavelet coefficients, leading to a down-weighting of outliers that makes the method robust to outlying functions or regions of functions. The models are applied to a pancreatic cancer mass spectroscopy data set and compared with other recently developed functional classification methods.",,Y,,,

Previous work has elucidated the neurochemical basis underlying the ability to switch responses to a previously nonreinforced exemplar and to switch between attentional sets. However, the role of neuromodulators in task switching, the ability to rapidly switch between two or more cognitive tasks afforded by the same stimuli, is still poorly understood. We attempted to fill this gap by manipulating norepinephrine levels using stress manipulation (Study 1a, n = 48; between-group design), transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation at two different intensities (Study 1b, n = 48; sham-controlled between-group design), and pharmacological manipulation (Study 2, n = 24; double-blind crossover design), all of which increased salivary cortisol measures. Participants repeatedly switched between two cognitive tasks (classifying a digit as high/low [Task 1] or as odd/even [Task 2]), depending on the preceding cue. On each trial, a cue indicated the task to be performed. The cue-stimulus interval was varied to manipulate the time to prepare for the switch. Participants showed typical switch costs, which decreased with the time available for preparation. None of the manipulations modulated the size of the switch costs or the preparation effect, as supported by frequentist and Bayesian model comparisons. Task-switching performance reflects a complex mix of cognitive control and bottom-up dynamics of task-set representations. Our findings suggest that norepinephrine does not affect either of these aspects of cognitive flexibility.",,Y,,,

However, reduced complexity of island communities can also present ecological opportunities. For example, amphibian diversity on Sulawesi Island is lower than it is in the Philippines, but Sulawesi supports a surprising diversity of Sulawesi fanged frogs (Limnonectes). Here we examine molecular, morphological, and geographical variation of fanged frogs from these two regions. Using genealogical concordance, morphology, and a Bayesian approach to species delimitation, we identified 13 species on Sulawesi, only four of which have been previously described. After evolutionary history is accounted for, a model with multiple body size optima in sympatric species is favored over a ""random-walk"" model of body size evolution. Additionally, morphological variation is higher among sympatric than nonsympatric species on Sulawesi but not in the Philippines. These findings suggest that adaptive radiation of fanged frogs on Sulawesi was driven by natural selection to infiltrate ecological niches occupied by other frog lineages in the Philippines. This supports a role of ecological opportunity in community assembly: diversification in mature communities, such as the Philippines, is limited by a dearth of unoccupied ecological niches. On Sulawesi, evolutionary novelties originated in a predictable and replicated fashion in response to opportunities presented by a depauperate ancestral community.",,Y,,,

Objective: To assess the utility of pathologic complete response (pCR) for neoadjuvant drug development in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2 [also referred to as ERBB2])-positive breast cancer. Data sources: We searched MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CENTRAL (Wiley), and Northern Light Life Sciences Conference Abstracts (Ovid) in December 2014. Searches combined terms for ""breast cancer"" and ""neoadjuvant therapy,"" with no limit on publication date. Study selection: Cohort studies and RCTs were selected that met following criteria: stages I to III HER2-positive breast cancer, neoadjuvant therapy, and reports of both pCR and an event-free survival (EFS)-type outcome. The initial search identified 2614 publications, of which 38 studies met the selection criteria. Data extraction and synthesis: Two authors independently screened each study for inclusion and extracted the data. Data were analyzed using Bayesian hierarchical models. Main outcomes and measures: Event-free survival and overall survival (OS) hazard ratios (HRs) for pCR vs non-pCR.

Results: A total of 36 studies with EFS by pCR status representing 5768 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer were included in the patient-level analysis. Overall, the improvement in EFS for pCR vs non-pCR was substantial: HR, 0.37 (95% probability interval [PI], 0.32-0.43).

In RCTs, the R2 correlations between odds ratios for pCR and HRs were 0.63 for EFS and 0.29 for OS. Based on absolute treatment improvements in pCR rate, predicted HRs for EFS for RCTs were concordant with observed HRs. Conclusions and relevance: Pathologic complete response in HER2-positive breast cancer is associated with substantially longer times to recurrence and death. This relationship is maintained in RCTs. For any particular new therapy the relationship between pCR and survival may differ. Quantifying the importance of pCR is necessary for designing efficient clinical trials, which should adapt to the relationship between pCR and survival for the therapy under investigation.",,Y,,,

For forest trees, climate is one of the most important drivers of adaptive phenotypic traits. Correlations of single and multilocus genotypes with environmental gradients have been identified for a variety of forest trees. These correlations are interpreted normally as evidence of natural selection. Here, we use a genome-wide dataset of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) typed from 1730 loci in 682 loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) trees sampled from 54 local populations covering the full-range of the species to examine allelic correlations to five multivariate measures of climate. Applications of a Bayesian generalized linear mixed model, where the climate variable was a fixed effect and an estimated variance-covariance matrix controlled random effects due to shared population history, identified several well-supported SNPs associating to principal components corresponding to geography, temperature, growing degree-days, precipitation and aridity. Functional annotation of those genes with putative orthologs in Arabidopsis revealed a diverse set of abiotic stress response genes ranging from transmembrane proteins to proteins involved in sugar metabolism. Many of these SNPs also had large allele frequency differences among populations (F(ST) = 0.10-0.35). These results illustrate a first step towards a ecosystem perspective of population genomics for non-model organisms, but also highlight the need for further integration of the methodologies employed in spatial statistics, population genetics and climate modeling during scans for signatures of natural selection from genomic data.",,Y,,,

Despite effective prevention interventions, chronic HCV prevalence remains around 40% among people who inject drugs (PWID). New direct-acting antiviral (DAA) HCV therapies combine high cure rates (>90%) and short treatment duration (8 to 12 weeks). Theoretical mathematical modelling evidence suggests HCV treatment scale-up can prevent transmission and substantially reduce HCV prevalence/incidence among PWID. Our primary aim is to generate empirical evidence on the effectiveness of HCV 'Treatment as Prevention' (TasP) in PWID. Methods and analysis: We plan to establish a natural experiment with Tayside, Scotland, as a single intervention site where HCV care pathways are being expanded (including specialist drug treatment clinics, needle and syringe programmes (NSPs), pharmacies and prison) and HCV treatment for PWID is being rapidly scaled-up. Other sites in Scotland and England will act as potential controls. Over 2 years from 2017/2018, at least 500 PWID will be treated in Tayside, which simulation studies project will reduce chronic HCV prevalence among PWID by 62% (from 26% to 10%) and HCV incidence will fall by approximately 2/3 (from 4.2 per 100 person-years (p100py) to 1.4 p100py). Treatment response and re-infection rates will be monitored. We will conduct focus groups and interviews with service providers and patients that accept and decline treatment to identify barriers and facilitators in implementing TasP. We will conduct longitudinal interviews with up to 40 PWID to assess whether successful HCV treatment alters their perspectives on and engagement with drug treatment and recovery. Trained peer researchers will be involved in data collection and dissemination. The primary outcome - chronic HCV prevalence in PWID - is measured using information from the Needle Exchange Surveillance Initiative survey in Scotland and the Unlinked Anonymous Monitoring Programme in England, conducted at least four times before and three times during and after the intervention. We will adapt Bayesian synthetic control methods (specifically the Causal Impact Method) to generate the cumulative impact of the intervention on chronic HCV prevalence and incidence. We will use a dynamic HCV transmission and economic model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the HCV TasP intervention, and to estimate the contribution of the scale-up in HCV treatment to observe changes in HCV prevalence. Through the qualitative data we will systematically explore key mechanisms of TasP real world implementation from provider and patient perspectives to develop a manual for scaling up HCV treatment in other settings. We will compare qualitative accounts of drug treatment and recovery with a 'virtual cohort' of PWID linking information on HCV treatment with Scottish Drug treatment databases to test whether DAA treatment improves drug treatment outcomes. Ethics and dissemination: Extending HCV community care pathways is covered by ethics (ERADICATE C, ISRCTN27564683, Super DOT C Trial clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02706223). Ethical approval for extra data collection from patients including health utilities and qualitative interviews has been granted (REC ref: 18/ES/0128) and ISCRCTN registration has been completed (ISRCTN72038467). Our findings will have direct National Health Service and patient relevance; informing prioritisation given to early HCV treatment for PWID. We will present findings to practitioners and policymakers, and support design of an evaluation of HCV TasP in England.

Here, we adapt a cueing task to measure spatial cueing effects on the decisions of honeybees and compare their behavior to that of humans and monkeys in a similarly structured two-alternative forced-choice perceptual task. Unlike the typical cueing paradigm in which the stimulus strength remains unchanged within a block of trials, for the monkey and human studies we randomized the contrast of the signal to simulate more real world conditions in which the organism is uncertain about the strength of the signal. A Bayesian ideal observer that weights sensory evidence from cued and uncued locations based on the cue validity to maximize overall performance is used as a benchmark of comparison against the three animals and other suboptimal models: probability matching, ignore the cue, always follow the cue, and an additive bias/single decision threshold model. We find that the cueing effect is pervasive across all three species but is smaller in size than that shown by the Bayesian ideal observer. Humans show a larger cueing effect than monkeys and bees show the smallest effect. The cueing effect and overall performance of the honeybees allows rejection of the models in which the bees are ignoring the cue, following the cue and disregarding stimuli to be discriminated, or adopting a probability matching strategy. Stimulus strength uncertainty also reduces the theoretically predicted variation in cueing effect with stimulus strength of an optimal Bayesian observer and diminishes the size of the cueing effect when stimulus strength is low. A more biologically plausible model that includes an additive bias to the sensory response from the cued location, although not mathematically equivalent to the optimal observer for the case stimulus strength uncertainty, can approximate the benefits of the more computationally complex optimal Bayesian model. We discuss the implications of our findings on the field's common conceptualization of covert visual attention in the cueing task and what aspects, if any, might be unique to humans.",,Y,,,

Here, we analysed speciation patterns of the kleptoparasitic spider, Argyrodes lanyuensis, through genomic analyses and tested for possible genetic evidence of adaptive introgression at the Taiwan-Philippines transition zone. Our study used highly polymorphic SNPs to demonstrate that speciation occurred when the Hualien (on Taiwan Island + Green Island) and Orchid Island + Philippine lineages separated during the early to mid-Pleistocene. The best colonisation model suggested by approximate Bayesian computation and random forests and biogeographical analyses supported an inference of a bottleneck during speciation, an interpretation reinforced by observation of lower FST values and reduced genetic diversity of the Orchid Island + Philippines lineage. We also found the highest support for the occurrence of introgression on the youngest island (Green Island) of the Taiwan-Philippines transition zone based on the ABBA-BABA test. Our study highlights the inference of two noteworthy species (Hualien + Green Island and Orchid Island + Philippines) based on our species delimitation tests, with gene flow between Green Island and Orchid Island that indicates introgression. The potential adaptive alleles in Green Island population, which are under balancing selection, provide initial evidence of possible rare case of adaptive introgression. This could represent an evolutionary response to a newly formed niche (or novel geographical context) lying between the tropical climate of the Philippines and the subtropical climate of Hualien, Taiwan.

RS-HDMR is a multivariate regression method that decomposes network interactions into a hierarchy of non-linear component functions. Sensitivity analysis based on these functions provides a clear physical and statistical interpretation of the underlying network structure. The advantages of RS-HDMR include efficient extraction of nonlinear and cooperative network relationships without resorting to discretization, prediction of network behavior without mechanistic modeling, robustness to data noise, and favorable scalability of the sampling requirement with respect to network size. As a proof-of-principle study, RS-HDMR was applied to experimental data measuring the single-cell response of a protein-protein signaling network to various experimental perturbations. A comparison to network structure identified in the literature and through other inference methods, including Bayesian and mutual-information based algorithms, suggests that RS-HDMR can successfully reveal a network structure with a low false positive rate while still capturing non-linear and cooperative interactions. RS-HDMR identified several higher-order network interactions that correspond to known feedback regulations among multiple network species and that were unidentified by other network inference methods. Furthermore, RS-HDMR has a better ability to predict network response under unsampled conditions in this application than the best statistical inference algorithm presented in the recent DREAM3 signaling-prediction competition. RS-HDMR can discern and predict differences in network state that arise from sources ranging from intrinsic cell-cell variability to altered experimental conditions, such as when drug perturbations are introduced. This ability ultimately allows RS-HDMR to accurately classify the experimental conditions of a given sample based on its observed network state.",,Y,,,

Outcomes: Statistical efficiency was measured using relative design (D-) efficiency, D-optimality, or D-error. Methods: For this systematic survey, we searched Journal Storage (JSTOR), Since Direct, PubMed, and OVID which included a search within EMBASE. Searches were conducted up to year 2016 for simulation studies investigating the impact of DCE design features on statistical efficiency. Studies were screened and data were extracted independently and in duplicate. Results for each included study were summarized by design characteristic. Previously developed criteria for reporting quality of simulation studies were also adapted and applied to each included study. Results: Of 371 potentially relevant studies, 9 were found to be eligible, with several varying in study objectives. Statistical efficiency improved when increasing the number of choice tasks or alternatives; decreasing the number of attributes, attribute levels; using an unrestricted continuous ""manipulator"" attribute; using model-based approaches with covariates incorporating response behaviour; using sampling approaches that incorporate previous knowledge of response behaviour; incorporating heterogeneity in a model-based design; correctly specifying Bayesian priors; minimizing parameter prior variances; and using an appropriate method to create the DCE design for the research question. The simulation studies performed well in terms of reporting quality. Improvement is needed in regards to clearly specifying study objectives, number of failures, random number generators, starting seeds, and the software used. Conclusion: These results identify the best approaches to structure a DCE. An investigator can manipulate design characteristics to help reduce response burden and increase statistical efficiency. Since studies varied in their objectives, conclusions were made on several design characteristics, however, the validity of each conclusion was limited. Further research should be conducted to explore all conclusions in various design settings and scenarios. Additional reviews to explore other statistical efficiency outcomes and databases can also be performed to enhance the conclusions identified from this review.

This approach has been applied to classical phylogeographic data sets such as mitochondrial barcodes as well as reduced-genome polymorphism data sets that can yield 10,000s of SNPs, produced by emergent technologies such as RAD-seq and GBS. A strategy for the latter had been accomplished by adapting the site frequency spectrum to a novel summarization of population genomic data across multiple taxa called the aggregate site frequency spectrum (aSFS), which potentially can be deployed under various inferential frameworks including approximate Bayesian computation, random forest and composite likelihood optimization. Here, we introduce the r package multi-dice, a wrapper program that exploits existing simulation software for flexible execution of hierarchical model-based inference using the aSFS, which is derived from reduced genome data, as well as mitochondrial data. We validate several novel software features such as applying alternative inferential frameworks, enforcing a minimal threshold of time surrounding co-demographic pulses and specifying flexible hyperprior distributions. In sum, multi-dice provides comparative analysis within the familiar R environment while allowing a high degree of user customization, and will thus serve as a tool for comparative phylogeography and population genomics.

Patients and methods: We included 55 patients with PCNSL and available pharmacokinetic (PK) data from the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group (IELSG) no. 20 trial, randomised to HD-MTX (n=30) or HD-MTX and high-dose cytarabine (HD-AraC) (n=25). Individual AUC(HD-MTX) from population PK analysis was tested on drug toxicity and clinical outcome using multivariate logistic regression analysis and Cox hazards modelling. Results: AUC(HD-MTX), the IELSG score and treatment group were significant predictors for treatment response (complete or partial) in the adjusted model. The AUC(HD-MTX) did not predict toxicity, with the exception of liver toxicity and neutropaenia. A high AUC(HD-MTX) was associated with better event-free survival (EFS) (P=0.01) and overall survival (OAS) (P=0.02).

Conclusions: Individualised dosing of HD-MTX might have the potential to improve clinical outcome in patients with PCNSL, even when administered concurrently with HD-AraC.

We applied the procedure to the design of a placebo-controlled, sequential trial in rheumatoid arthritis, in each stage of which patients were randomized between placebo and all dose levels that currently appeared safe and non-futile.

Their effectiveness has not been evaluated for chromatographic method development using standardized comparisons across factors such as sample complexity, chromatographic response functions (CRFs), gradient complexity, and application type. This study compares six optimization algorithms - Bayesian optimization (BO), differential evolution (DE), a genetic algorithm (GA), covariance-matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES), random search, and grid search - for the development of gradient elution LC methods. Utilizing a multi-linear retention modeling framework, these algorithms were assessed across diverse samples, CRFs, and gradient segments, considering two observation modes: dry (in silico, deconvoluted), and wet (search-based, requiring peak detection). The optimization algorithms were evaluated based on their data (i.e. number of iterations) and time efficiency. Of the algorithms compared in this study, DE proved to be a highly competitive method for dry optimization purposes in terms of both data and time efficiency. BO outperformed all other algorithms in terms of data efficiency and was found to be most effective for search-based optimization, which requires a low number of iterations (<200). However, BO was found to be impractical for dry optimization requiring a large iteration budget due to its unfavorable computational scaling. It was observed that both the CRF and the sample have a strong influence on the efficiency of the algorithms, emphasizing the need for better benchmark samples and highlighting the importance of assessing CRF-induced complexity in the optimization landscape.

While some species tend to fit with standard theoretical phylogeographic expectations (e.g. bears), others show little obvious modern phylogeographic structure (e.g. wolves). In this study we briefly review these studies, and present a new phylogeographical study of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) throughout Europe, using a combination of ancient DNA sequences obtained from museum specimens, and modern sequences collated from GenBank. We used cytochrome b (250 bp) and the mitochondrial control region (268 bp) to elucidate both current and historical phylogeographical patterning. Results: We found evidence for slight isolation by distance in modern populations, as well as differentiation associated with time, both of which can likely be attributed to random genetic drift. Despite high sequence diversity (11.2% cytochrome b, 16.4% control region), no evidence for spatial structure (from Bayesian trees) is found either in modern samples or ancient samples for either gene, and Bayesian skyline plots suggested little change in the effective population size over the past 40,000 years. Conclusions: It is probable that the high dispersal ability and adaptability of the red fox has contributed to the lack of observable differentiation, which appears to have remained consistent over tens of thousands of years. Generalised patterns of how animals are thought to have responded to historical climatic change are not necessarily valid for all species, and so understanding the differences between species will be critical for predicting how species will be affected by future climatic change.",,Y,,,

Estimating burden of diseases using statistical models is inevitable especially in the context of rare data availability. To this purpose, the spatio-temporal model can provide a statistically sound approach for explaining the response variable observed over a region and various times. However, there are some methodological challenges in analysis of these complex data. Our primary objective is to provide some remedies to overcome these challenges. Method: Data from nationally representative surveys and systematic reviews have been gathered across contiguous areal units over a period of more than 20 years (1990 - 2013). Generally, observations of areal units are spatially and temporally correlated in such a way that observations closer in space and time tend to be more correlated than observations farther away. It is critical to determine the correlation structure in space-time process which has been observed over a set of irregular regions. Moreover, these data sets are subject to high percentage of missing, including misaligned areal units, areas with small sample size, and may have nonlinear trends over space and time. Furthermore, the Gaussian assumption might be overly restrictive to represent the data. In this setting, the traditional statistical techniques are not appropriate and more flexible and comprehensive methodology is required. Particularly, we focus on approaches that allow extending spatio-temporal models proposed previously in the literature.Since statistical models include both continuous and categorical outcomes, we assume a latent variable framework for describing the underlying structure in mixed outcomes and use a conditionally autoregressive (CAR) prior for the random effects. In addition, we will employ misalignment modeling to combine incompatible areal units between data sources and/or over the years to obtain a unified clear picture of population health status over this period. In order to take parameter uncertainties into account, we pursue a Bayesian sampling-based inference. Hence, a hierarchical Bayes approach is constructed to model the data. The hierarchical structure enables us to ""borrow information"" from neighboring areal units to improve estimates for areas with missing values and small number of observations. For their general applicability and ease of implementation, the MCMC methods are the most adapted tool to perform Bayesian inference. Conclusion: This study aims to combine different available data sources and produce precise and reliable evidences for Iranian burden of diseases and risk factors and their disparities among geographical regions over time. Providing appropriate statistical methods and models for analyzing the data is undoubtedly crucial to circumvent the problems and obtain satisfactory estimates of model parameters and reach accurate assessment.",,Y,,,

The strategy proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) is to systematically compare the therapeutic efficacy of antimalarial drugs using as primary outcome for efficacy, a four-category ordered criterion. The objective of the present work was to analyze the treatment effects on this primary outcome taking into account both a center-effect and individual covariates. A three-arm, three-centre trial of Amodiaquine (AQ), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and their combination (AQ + SP), conducted by OCEAC-IRD in 2003, in 538 children with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria, is used as an illustration. Methods: Analyses were based on ordinal regression methods, assuming an underlying continuous latent variable, using either the proportional odds (PO) or the proportional hazards (PH) models. Different algorithms, corresponding to both frequentist- and bayesian-approaches, were implemented using the freely available softwares R and Winbugs, respectively. The performances of the different methods were evaluated on a simulated data set, and then they were applied on the trial data set. Results: Good coverage probability and type-1 error for the treatment effect were achieved. When the methods were applied on the trial data set, results highlighted a significance decrease of SP efficacy when compared to AQ (PO, odds ratio [OR] 0.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.57; hazard ratio [HR] 0.605, 95% CI 0.42-0.82), and an equal effectiveness between AQ + SP and AQ (PO, odds ratio [OR] 1.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-11.44; hazard ratio [HR] 1.40, 95% CI 0.88-2.18). The body temperature was significantly related to the responses. The patient weights were marginally associated to the clinical response.

According to Bayesian theories, higher uncertainty should influence how the brain adapts motor commands in response to perceived errors. Such adaptation may critically influence how patients interact with their prosthetic devices; however, we do not yet understand adaptation behavior with EMG control. Models of adaptation can offer insights on movement planning and feedback correction, but we first need to establish their validity for EMG control interfaces. Here we created a simplified comparison of prosthesis and able-bodied control by studying adaptation with three control interfaces: joint angle, joint torque, and EMG. Subjects used each of the control interfaces to perform a target-directed task with random visual perturbations. We investigated how control interface and visual uncertainty affected trial-by-trial adaptation. As predicted by Bayesian models, increased errors and decreased visual uncertainty led to faster adaptation. The control interface had no significant effect beyond influencing error sizes. This result suggests that Bayesian models are useful for describing prosthesis control and could facilitate further investigation to characterize the uncertainty faced by prosthesis users. A better understanding of factors affecting movement uncertainty will guide sensory feedback strategies for powered prostheses and clarify what feedback information best improves control.

A maize bi-parental doubled haploid (DH) population derived from F1, which consisted of 97 lines was evaluated in testcross combination under heat stress as well as combined heat and drought stress during the 2014 and 2016 summer season in Ciudad Obregon, Sonora, Mexico (27°20"" N, 109°54"" W, 38 m asl). Full hyperspectral data, indicative of crop physiological processes at the canopy level, was repeatedly measured throughout the grain filling period and related to grain yield. Partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF), ridge regression (RR) and Bayesian ridge regression (BayesB) were used to assess prediction accuracies on grain yield within (two-fold cross-validation) and across environments (leave-one-environment-out-cross-validation) using molecular markers (M), hyperspectral data (H) and the combination of both (HM). Highest prediction accuracy for grain yield averaged across within and across location predictions (rGP) were obtained for BayesB followed by RR, RF and PLSR.

The highest prediction accuracy for grain yield across environments was measured for BayesB when molecular marker data and hyperspectral data were used as input factors, while the highest within environment prediction was obtained when BayesB was used in combination with hyperspectral data. It is discussed how the combined use of hyperspectral data with molecular marker technology could be used to introduce physiological genomic estimated breeding values (PGEBV) as a pre-harvest decision support tool to select genetically superior lines.",,Y,,,

Our goal is to characterize any systematic regional differences in the mating chirps and assess whether individual bats have signature chirps. The data are analyzed by modeling spectrograms of the chirps as responses in a Bayesian functional mixed model. Given the variable chirp lengths, we compute the spectrograms on a relative time scale interpretable as the relative chirp position, using a variable window overlap based on chirp length. We use 2D wavelet transforms to capture correlation within the spectrogram in our modeling and obtain adaptive regularization of the estimates and inference for the regions-specific spectrograms. Our model includes random effect spectrograms at the bat level to account for correlation among chirps from the same bat, and to assess relative variability in chirp spectrograms within and between bats. The modeling of spectrograms using functional mixed models is a general approach for the analysis of replicated nonstationary time series, such as our acoustical signals, to relate aspects of the signals to various predictors, while accounting for between-signal structure. This can be done on raw spectrograms when all signals are of the same length, and can be done using spectrograms defined on a relative time scale for signals of variable length in settings where the idea of defining correspondence across signals based on relative position is sensible.

To address this situation, extensive computer simulations were performed using partial credit items with two, three, four, and five response categories. Other variables manipulated include the number of available items, the number of respondents used to calibrate the items, and various manipulations of respondents' true locations. Three item selection strategies were used, and the theoretically optimal Maximum Information method was compared to random item selection and Bayesian Maximum Falsification approaches. The Rasch partial credit model proved to be quite robust to various imperfections, and systematic distortions did occur mainly in the absence of sufficient numbers of items located near the trait or performance levels of interest. The findings further indicate that having small numbers of items is more problematic in practice than having small numbers of respondents to calibrate these items. Most importantly, increasing the number of response categories consistently improved CAT's efficiency as well as the general quality of the results. In fact, increasing the number of response categories proved to have a greater positive impact than did the choice of item selection method, as the Maximum Information approach performed only slightly better than the Maximum Falsification approach. Accordingly, issues related to the efficiency of item selection methods are far less important than is commonly suggested in the literature. However, being based on computer simulations only, the preceding presumes that actual respondents behave according to the Rasch model. CAT research could thus benefit from empirical studies aimed at determining whether, and if so, how, selection strategies impact performance.",,Y,,,

The approach extends previous work by Lang et al. for Gaussian responses. Nonlinear functions are modelled by first or second order random walk priors with locally varying variances or smoothing parameters. Estimation is fully Bayesian and uses latent utility representations of binary regression models for efficient block sampling from the full conditionals of nonlinear functions.,,Y,,,
344,N Lange,1997;5(4):259-63.,"Empirical and substantive models, the Bayesian paradigm, and meta-analysis in functional brain imaging",20408226,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20408226,"Abstract Functional neuroimaging research is currently rediscovering and adapting established statistical methods for its use, including design of experiments, the general linear model, contrasts, random field theory, longitudinal models, Fourier analysis, and general signal and image processing methods. This brief paper gives an example of comparative performance of five different statistical models applied to the same set of data generated in an fMRI study of motor cortex. These methods include a two-sample t-statistic, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, a principal component/canonical variates approach, a pruned feed-forward artificial neural network with one hidden layer, and a frequency domain regression convolution model allowing for spatially varying hemodynamic responses. Produced by essentially empirical statistical models, there appear to be more similarities than differences in these spatial activation patterns, yet all lack explicit incorporation of substantive prior information. Distinctions are drawn between exploratory models for hypothesis generation and confirmatory models for hypothesis testing. In addition, the Bayesian paradigm helps to combine empirical and substantive models, and meta-analysis provides a rational means by which to combine information over a range of similar results affected minimally by publication bias.",,Y,,,
