BAN2401-G000-201 Core study is an 18-month study in which 3 dose levels (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) are given biweekly (once every 2 weeks) to separate groups of participants and 2 dose levels (5 and 10 mg/kg) are given monthly (once every 4 weeks) to separate groups of participants. Participants will be from 2 clinical subgroups: mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild Alzheimer's disease dementia. Frequent interim analyses will be conducted to continually update randomization allocation on the basis of the primary clinical endpoint. Any participant who completes the study treatment (Visit 42 \[Week 79\] of the Core study) or discontinues the Core Study will be eligible to participate in the Extension Phase, provided they meet the Extension Phase inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Subjects will receive oral doses of GW856553 or placebo for six weeks. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, defined as biomarkers in blood and clinical symptoms, will be assessed.

The primary endpoint is the change from baseline associated with GW856553 versus placebo at Week 6 in the Bech (6-item HAMD-17) score. Interim analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed throughout the study to potentially adapt the study design by changing the randomization ratio and/ or reducing the total number of subjects to be randomized into the study. Exploratory analyses will be performed by associating changes in cytokine levels and selected clinical symptoms; PK/PD modelling will also be used to identify the most sensitive clinical and biological markers.","Depressive Disorder, Major",DRUG: GW856553|OTHER: Placebo,GlaxoSmithKline,,128,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",2009-09-25,2010-07-07,"GSK Investigational Site, Hoffman Estates, Illinois, 60169, United States|GSK Investigational Site, Park Ridge, Illinois, 60068, United States|GSK Investigational Site, New York, New York, 10128, United States|GSK Investigational Site, Columbus, Ohio, 43210, United States|GSK Investigational Site, Pazardzhik, 4400, Bulgaria|GSK Investigational Site, Plovdiv, 4000, Bulgaria|GSK Investigational Site, Ruse, Bulgaria|GSK Investigational Site, Sofia, 1113, Bulgaria|GSK Investigational Site, Tartu, 50417, Estonia|GSK Investigational Site, Huettenberg, Hessen, 35625, Germany|GSK Investigational Site, Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, 19053, Germany|GSK Investigational Site, Achim, Niedersachsen, 28832, Germany|GSK Investigational Site, Westerstede, Niedersachsen, 26655, Germany|GSK Investigational Site, Bielefeld, Nordrhein-Westfalen, 33647, Germany|GSK Investigational Site, Dresden, Sachsen, 01097, Germany|GSK Investigational Site, Berlin, 10629, Germany|GSK Investigational Site, Moscow, 107076, Russian Federation|GSK Investigational Site, Moscow, 125367, Russian Federation|GSK Investigational Site, Samara, 443016, Russian Federation|GSK Investigational Site, Smolensk, 214 019, Russian Federation|GSK Investigational Site, St-Petersburg, Russian Federation"

NCT05440851,Platform of Randomized Adaptive Clinical Trials in Critical Illness,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05440851,PRACTICAL,RECRUITING,"PRACTICAL:

PRACTICAL is a randomized multifactorial adaptive platform trial for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF). This platform trial will evaluate novel interventions for patients with AHRF across a range of severity states (i.e., not intubated, intubated with lower or higher respiratory system elastance, requiring extracorporeal life support) and across a range of investigational phases (i.e., preliminary mechanistic trials, full-scale clinical trials).

ULTIMATE domain (currently enrolling):

The ULTIMATE pilot trial is a multi-center, randomized, open-label trial, embedded as a domain within the PRACTICAL platform trial. This domain will evaluate the effect of ultra-low intensity ventilation facilitated by CO2 removal through VV-ECMO versus best current conventional ventilation on all-cause hospital mortality among patients with early moderate-severe AHRF with high respiratory system elastance receiving potentially injurious mechanical ventilation.

Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (IMV) Strategies domain:

The IMV Strategies domain will evaluate multiple novel invasive ventilation strategies in comparison to conventional lung-protective ventilation in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF). Multiple approaches to mechanical ventilation are used, and the optimal approach is unknown. An efficient strategy to identify the best strategy is to compare multiple potential approaches simultaneously to determine more rapidly (a) which interventions are least effective (and should be dropped), and (b) which interventions result in the best outcomes for patients. In the current domain design, we will compare the current recommended ventilation strategy to two new approaches: a strategy that targets lung-inflating (driving) pressure instead of lung-inflating (tidal) volume, and a strategy that aims to maintain an optimal level of breathing effort to prevent diaphragm atrophy and injury while maintaining safe lung-inflating pressures.

CORT-E2:

The Corticosteroid Early and Extended (CORT-E2) Trial is a phase III, multicentre Bayesian randomized controlled trial (RCT), which includes two cohorts within the domain; one examining the role of early corticosteroids as compared to not extending in persisting AHRF due to COVID or non-COVID (Extended Cohort).",Respiratory Insufficiency|Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Complication|Mechanical Ventilation Pressure High,OTHER: Ultra-Protective Ventilation Facilitated by Extracorporeal Support|OTHER: Lung-Protective Ventilation (LPV)|OTHER: Driving Pressure-Limited Ventilation (DPL)|OTHER: Lung- and Diaphragm-Protective Ventilation and Sedation (LDPVS)|DRUG: Early Cohort corticosteroid dose|DRUG: Extended Cohort corticosteroid dose|DRUG: Usual care without routine corticosteroids|DRUG: Usual care without extending corticosteroids,"University Health Network, Toronto",,6250,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",2023-04-30,2024-12-31,"University Health Network, Toronto, Canada"

NCT04754672,Aerobic Fitness or Muscle Mass Training to Improve Colorectal Cancer Outcome,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04754672,AMICO,RECRUITING,"Evidence from randomized controlled trials shows that exercise during cancer treatment benefits physical fitness, fatigue and quality of life. Since the effect of exercise on clinical outcome is currently unknown, exercise is not included as integral part of standard cancer care. Moreover, evidence regarding the optimal exercise prescription in terms of type and dose is lacking.

To maintain quality of life in patients receiving palliative treatment with chemotherapy, toxicity-induced modifications in the prescribed chemotherapy dose are common. Such modifications - occurring in 40% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer - may reduce benefit of treatment. The investigators hypothesize that exercise prevents chemotherapy dose modifications by reducing toxicity and enhancing psychological strength. Additionally, based on studies in rodents and preliminary data in patients with cancer, the researchers hypothesize that exercise has beneficial effects on the functionality of the natural killer cells, which play an important role in the innate immune defense against cancer. Both, fewer dose modifications and improved immune function may improve progression-free survival.

This study is a three-armed trial comparing resistance exercise, aerobic interval exercise and usual care in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to select the optimal exercise prescription for preventing chemotherapy dose modifications. The trial will use a Bayesian adaptive multi-arm multi-stage design with several interim analyses after which an ineffective study arm can be dropped early. This novel design makes the trial more efficient and reduces patients' exposure to suboptimal study arms.

Evidence regarding the exercise effects on i) clinical outcome, ii) the optimal exercise prescription, and iii) the underlying mechanisms, elucidates the potential of exercise to boost benefit from chemotherapy treatment.

1. Tuberculosis Preventive Treatment (TPT) is given to healthy people and needs to be safe;
2. Tuberculosis Preventive Treatment (TPT) with shorter regimens are superior with respect to acceptance, completion, and costs;
3. 4 months of Rifampin 10mg/kg (4R10) is the safest regimen, but is completed by \<80% of patients;
4. The safety of 2 months of Rifampin 20mg/kg (2R20) is similar to that of 4 months of Rifampin 10mg/kg (4R10), but completion is a concern;
5. 1-month regimens have promising efficacy;
6. Safety and tolerability must be carefully assessed with comparisons to 4 months of Rifampin 10mg/kg (4R10), and head-to-head with each other.

OBJECTIVES: The investigator will use a Bayesian adaptive Phase 2 randomized open-label trial design to test at least three experimental Tuberculosis Preventive Treatment (TPT) regimens to identify at least one regimen of ≤2 months duration that has non-inferior safety, completion, and tolerability in adults and children relative to the reference Tuberculosis Preventive Treatment (TPT) regimen. The shortest, safest, and best tolerated regimen identified in this Phase 2 trial will be tested for effectiveness and efficacy in a Phase 3 trial.

Specific Tuberculosis Preventive Treatment (TPT) regimens (All are daily and self-administered) Reference: Rifampin at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day for 4 months (4R10); Experimental: 1) Rifampin at 20 mg/kg/day for 2 months (2R20); (2) one month Levofloxacin and Rifapentine (1LP). At a later stage a 3rd experimental regimen will be selected and added: one another novel 1-2-month regimen identified from pre-clinical and clinical studies.

NCT04372589,Antithrombotic Therapy to Ameliorate Complications of COVID-19 (ATTACC),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04372589,ATTACC,COMPLETED,"Endothelial injury as a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to a dysregulated host inflammatory response and activation of coagulation pathways. Macro- and micro-vascular thrombosis may contribute to morbidity, organ failure, and death. Therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin may improve clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 through anti-thrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-viral activities of heparins. This pragmatic, Bayesian adaptive randomized controlled trial will determine whether therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin (subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin or intravenous unfractionated heparin) versus usual care reduces the need for intubation or death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The trial uses an adaptive design which was chosen to overcome limitations in available data to inform a priori estimation of event rates and possible effect sizes. The adaptive design also includes response-adaptive randomization based on baseline D-dimer level, probing for differential efficacy across subgroups defined based on initial D-dimer level.

NCT02428543,Ponatinib for FLT3-ITD Acute Myelogenous Leukemia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02428543,PONATINIB-AML,UNKNOWN,"This project is part of a joint ALFA and GOELAM strategy aiming to improve the survival of patients with newly diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) aged 18-70 years. The basis of this strategy is to evaluate intensified conventional chemotherapy and targeted drugs in selected disease-risk subgroups of adult patients with non promyelocytic AML. Participation will be proposed to almost all adult patients in France aged 18-70 years and diagnosed with AML.

FLT3 genetic alterations include FLT3 somatic point mutations within the second tyrosine kinase domain and internal duplications of the juxta-membrane domain. This alteration is refered to as FLT3-ITD. The FLT3-ITD mutation is found in around 30% of patients with cytogenetically normal AML. Patients with the FLT3-ITD genotype have been reported to have a poor outcome when treated with conventional chemotherapy with an estimated 4-year relapse-free survival of 25% (Schlenk et al. N Engl J Med 2008). More recently, the prognostic relevance of FLT3-ITD has been studied in the context of integrated genetic profiling. This confirmed the genetic complexity of AML and also that FLT3-ITD was associated with reduced overall survival in intermediate-risk AML. A multivariate analysis of several genetic alterations revealed that FLT3-ITD was the primary predictor of patient outcome. FLT3-ITD mutations were classified in 3 categories: 1) FLT3-ITD with +8, TET2, DNMT3A or MLL-PTD mutations (3-year OS 14.5%); 2) FLT3-ITD with wild type CEBPA, TET2, DNMT3 and MLL-PTD (3-year OS 35.2%) and 3) FLT3-ITD with CEBPA mutations (3-year OS 42%) (Patel JP et al. N Engl J Med 2012). However, FLT3-ITD was not a predictor of response to induction therapy, allowing the introduction of targeted therapies after the induction course.

Several FLT3 inhibitors have been evaluated or are currently being tested in the setting of relapsing AML. In most trials to date, patients were only eligible if the FLT3-ITD mutation was present. Disappointing results were reported with the first generation of FLT3 inhibitors, including lestaurtinib (CEP-701), midostaurin (PKC-412) and sorafenib. Second generation FLT3 inhibitors such as quizartinib (AC220) are currently under investigation with promising results. However, the hematologic toxicity of AC220 will likely present a major limitation in evaluating AC220 combined with standard or high-dose chemotherapy.

Ponatinib (AP24534) is a third generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase domain. Ponatinib was rationally designed with an extensive network of optimized molecular contacts and triple bonds to accommodate the T315I mutation, a major cause of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in chronic and advanced phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Ponatinib also inhibits SRC (IC50: 5.4 nM) and members of the VEGFR, FGFR, and PDGFR families of receptor tyrosine kinases (O'Hare T, Cancer Cell 2009). Despite low activity against FLT3 based on the IC50 value (FLT3 IC50: 12.6 nM compared to BCR IC50: 0.37 nM), ponatinib has recently been reported to have significant cellular activity against the MV4-11 cell line which harbors an FLT3-ITD activating mutation. Ponatinib-induced apoptosis was maximal at 10 nM in vitro and a single dose of 5 and 10 mg/kg had a strong inhibitory effect in vivo in mice bearing MV4-11 xenografts. Primary blast cells from 4 FLT3-ITD AML patients were also tested and ponatinib reduced their viability (IC50: 4 nM) whereas no activity was shown on FLT3-ITD-negative blast cells (Gozgit JM et al. Mol Cancer Ther 2011).

Preliminary data from the phase I clinical trial showed that 15 mg ponatinib was associated with a Cmax of 51.1 nM. Cmax was increased to 111 nM and 149 nM in the 30 mg and 45 mg cohorts respectively. The trough concentrations were 55.3 nM and 61.9 nM for the 30 mg and 45 mg doses respectively (Ariad clinical investigator's brochure, version 3). Results from the ongoing phase II trial in CML patients suggest that the hematological toxicity profile of ponatinib is comparable with that of nilotinib or dasatinib, both of which have been successfully combined with conventional chemotherapy.

Investigators thus aim to combine ponatinib with cytarabine in FLT3-ITD AML patients in first complete remission.",Acute Myeloid Lukemia,DRUG: Ponatinib and Cytarabine,Versailles Hospital,,49,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2013-07,2023-11,"Dr Abdelaziz CHAIB, Aix-en-Provence, 13600, France|Chu Amiens, Amiens, 80054, France|CHU d'Angers, Angers, 49033, France|Hôpital VICTOR DUPOUY, Argenteuil, 95107, France|Dr Edouard RANDIAMALALA, Bayonne, 64100, France|CHU de Besançon, Besançon, 25030, France|Dr Thorsten BRAUN, Bobigny, 93000, France|CHU Boulogne Sur Mer, Boulogne Sur Mer cedex, 62321, France|Chr Clemenceau, Caen Cedex, 14033, France|Hôpital d'Instruction des Armées PERCY, Clamart, 92141, France|Dr Stéphanie HAÏAT, Corbeil-essonnes, 91100, France|Hôpital Henri Mondor, Créteil, 94010, France|CHU de Dijon, Dijon, 21079, France|Centre hospitalier de Versailles, Le Chesnay cedex, 78157, France|Hôpital Claude Huriez, Lille cedex, 59037, France|CHRU Dupuytren, Limoges cedex, 87042, France|Hôpital Edouard Herriot, Lyon cedex 03, 69437, France|Dr Regis COSTELLO, Marseille, 13000, France|Centre Hospitalier de Meaux, Meaux, 77104, France|Dr Mario OJEDA-URIBE, Mulhouse, 68000, France|Dr Jacques DELAUNAY, Nantes, 44000, France|CHU Nice, Hôpital Archet 1, Nice cedex 3, 06202, France|CHU de Nîmes, Nîmes, 30029, France|Hôpital Saint Antoine, Paris cedex 12, 75751, France|Hôpital Necker Enfants Malades, Paris cedex 15, 75743, France|Hôpital Saint Louis, Paris, 75010, France|Hôpital La Pitié Salpêtrière, Paris, 75013, France|Dr Laurence SANHES, Perpignan, 66000, France|Dr Arnaud PIGNEUX, Pessac, 33604, France|Centre Hospitalier René Dubos, Pontoise Cedex, 95303, France|Marc BERNARD, Rennes, 35000, France|Dr Emilie LEMASLE, Rouen, 76000, France|Centre Hospitalier René Huguenin, Saint Cloud, 92210, France|Institut de Cancérologie de la Loire, Saint-Priest-en-Jarez, 42270, France|Dr Réda GARIDI, Saint-Quentin, 02100, France|Dr Christian RECHER, Toulouse, 31000, France|Centre Hospitalier de Valenciennes, Valenciennes, 59322, France"

NCT02061202,Inhaled Mometasone to Reduce Painful Episodes in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02061202,IMPROVE,COMPLETED,"The proposed research is designed to test the global hypothesis that inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), a therapy developed to treat asthma, will prevent vasoocclusive painful episodes in adults with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) who wheeze, but do not meet criteria for a diagnosis of asthma. The specific aims of this proposal are 1) Conduct a feasibility study - a randomized controlled trial of ICS for adults with SCD who do not meet criteria for a diagnosis of asthma but report recurrent cough or wheezing, 2) Measure the effects of ICS on biological correlates of pulmonary inflammation (as determined by exhaled nitric oxide) and vascular injury (as determined by sVCAM) in SCD, and 3) Compare properties of traditional and Bayesian adaptive clinical trial design for therapeutic trials in SCD in preparation for designing a definitive trial of ICS. These aims have the potential to 1) change the standard of care for individuals with SCD and recurrent cough or wheeze, 2) provide insight into the pathogenesis of non-asthmatic wheezing in SCD and its response to treatment, 3) explore the suitability of innovative clinical trial designs to overcome the challenges that have hindered therapeutic innovation for SCD.",Sickle Cell Disease,DRUG: Mometasone Furoate|DRUG: Placebo,Jeffrey Glassberg,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)",54,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",2014-03,2017-11,"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, 10029, United States"
